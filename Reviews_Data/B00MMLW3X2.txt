R227VCISIZJ79E->The USB 3 is a real deal! The touchscreen works flawlessly. Had the SSD replacement and it was faster since it came to me as cheap and slow compared to other laptops that I have tried. There's a noise coming from the hard drive. The touch pad also feels cheap.
R1140YM7TUOVCO->Batery died after 1 year.
R18NYCFY0B5M1L->Cons:Been using it for 2 months so far so good. Only thing is boot up time slow. Pros: light, has all requirements for office work as well as personal e.g. hdmi, usb 2.0 and 3.0, battery life good.
R1E1R8QW0G9AK2->I am very impressed with this Asus Notebook. The first thing I did was downloaded Windows 10. It took almost a full day to set it up the way I wanted, but everything is working great.
R2CN11XWXEEZLF->Cons The reason I have given it three stars instead of the full 5 that I would have is that I cannot access Microsoft Office. I don't know if this is because I activated the computer outside of the United States or if there was a product key included in the packaging that I never saw. I'm stuck and unable to work on documents, so I'm definitely not happy about this. Pros Other than the above, this little machine is excellent!! It's light and fast and works just as advertised, and even better. I was able to get my windows 10 update with no issues. It works like a charm. I'd definitely recommend this anyone looking for a notebook, if that MsOffice issue wasn't such a pain.
R2C3OCMNZR7QSN->I bought this computer as travel help and to take it to the University as an easy going computer, I like it very much, A very light computer , everything works for me, I am from Costa Rica and was kind of concern about buying this brand but I really recommended. I am not an exigent type of person on computers, For giving lessons, emails, some charts and surf on the net, works for me. Speakers 85% , mousepad  90% , you get what you pay for.
R1M6T55H6M9YZI->Did not buy from Amazon but as a long-time Amazon Prime member, I thought it is of value to post a review here. This computer is a piece of junk. It worked ok (nothing great, nothing bad, in the range of what you would expect in the $300 price range) but the battery died 2 months out of warranty. Problem is that the battery is not user replaceable. Which means that the notebook would have to be sent to Asus for repair. Because the unit is 2 months out of warranty, Asus will not cover the repair cost and quoted an estimated cost of $300 to fix it (in addition to the cost of mailing the unit to Asus), i.e. more than what I paid for the computer a little bit more than a year ago and also more to buy a brand-new replacement machine. I recommend to stay clear from this product and Asus in general for the following reasons: - non user replaceable battery - strict adherence to warranty policy even if product fails just outside of warranty - quote to repair is higher than original acquisition cost - I waited a full hour until I was able to speak to a live person
REHW5CW8ZOXZF->I hate this Laptop ! Lots of problems with the battery. Waited 10 days to fix it when it died suddenly. Lasted one month, and now the it will not charge. Do not buy this product.
RF7PZ64FMGFGN->Within 2 months I have to constantly restart due to unresponsiveness. I just want to dump it.
R2DNXISQ5WDQ91->Slow processor- okay for price paid thou.
R3EHDOP0FGGW1M->Not as good as I expected,but I update to WIN 10, it's a cheap price to experience WIN 10
R96QBCJ0Q68RT->After significant research online (days and days worth) I decided upon this device to use for school. It mostly sits on my coffee table. I carry it to class once a week for the past five weeks. During class a few weeks ago I picked it up to move it about one foot left and I heard something pop. It was a little black cover from the wires that go from the keyboard to the screen. Since that time, the screen has been popping apart at the base in the lower right corner. I finally had to superglue it to make it stop doing that. Given that I barely use this and I rarely travel with it (I take really good care of it) I didn't expect it to fall apart this easily. I'm really disappointed since I fell in love with the Asus Zenbook (through work) and wanted an affordable Asus for home. I'm past the return date, and this kind of thing doesn't show within 30 days so I'm kind of stuck. I guess I'll go with the Chromebook or Acer next time. Lesson learned!
RSCS96KMB1UP6->Works as expected.
R2G8N5OV0ET4PN->Very powerful! I upgraded to Windows 10 and is just perfect machine for traveling with all the power and elements of my desktop!
R117Z54AUCRN1Y->very nice laptop. the touchscreen is great.
R1Q44QA4DT2A2H->It's a little slow but decent for the money that I paid for it, still relatively new so hopefully it continues to run decently for the rest of the time I'm in college
R1FR0344SJXQM3->I hate the windows but the laptop does what i need it to do
R3TA9Z80HYVHIV->This is a powerful little laptop, my only complaint is the battery,  maybe I'm asking too much but it only lasts 3 hours. After that this is a great laptop, I can use photoshop, office etc with no problems.
R10JA0SVUJMGQ9->Small and powerful, great for college use!
R2GTK1G4V9UFTC->Does not live, it brings another revolutionary development of the computer industry. It has a fascinating design, with exciting and powerful. It has changed the relationship between man and computer conventional rigid fundamentally. You are free to take it away from you, close to you, with any of your position, like a sunflower as it makes our digital lives more bright, simple and exciting.
R1M3FZ683L1B66->Item delivered in reasonable time, and was as described.
RSAW5X3Q05OXD->I love my tactil display, the best for business
R1E2D0CVUTJOC3->Works great so far.  Hate Windows 8 but I hear there's an upgrade to 10 soon!
R3I07YSDJFTSE2->Great little notebook love the keyboard best purchase I've made in a while
R2ZGE4SRKXJKLI->thank you .. excellent item and fast shipping
RT6YLOMDZBX12->Very Good, Laptop, The ower person Really took care on this
R1QBWG6WFJYX5G->great..... I love it. ....thanks
R3K5PTJ46WUL1I->It has been really slow, so i had to return it
R3EB95I2G7I0WV->Keyboard does not fuction, returning laptop.
RQDWO767LWYPL->Purchased this laptop last year for my wife. Buying another for my son - who uses the wife's all the time. It is a good basic, lightweight touch screen Windows laptop that can handle most everyday activities. My younger son even has Steam downloaded on it and can play many games without complaint - but of course he still wants a Gaming PC. I plan to purchase an SSD and swap out the HDD.  There are videos on youtube that show how to open an X200 laptop - which is the same chassis as this laptop.
R2NGGSJU1R9RNG->Needed to upgrade my netbook and give my old one to my daughter. I really like Asus. I hunted around and finally found this one with a price I could live with. Everything works great. Finally figuring out 8.1 Windows and liking the touch screen and apps. The jack for the sound is the only thing I'm worried about. It's pretty generic plastic and if I don't have the headphones plugged in before I start a program or change a program in the middle, plug or unplug it. Sometimes it turns the sound off for the whole computer and I have to restart. Other than that another win for me with Asus.
R17HZDS0YIX2I3->This unit performs well for its purpose, a college student's essential machine, with the horsepower to aid in research, to enter and format  text, to do basic computation, and to access social media essential for modern college -- plus access for occasional entertainment for the family's elementary student.  So far, no problems at all.
R2YNEEWA1KFZXJ->Good budget laptop for anyone
R1S3X6UMAPCOV3->Small in size, light in weight, still quite performant .... used to control complex machinery in real time.
R3925Z73DE3HCB->My boyfriend bought this months before I did and loves his so I thought I'd try it out. This is great for going online, viewing photos, or doing anything school related (PowerPoint, word, excel, etc). Its fast and light enough to bring along for travel.
R26S1VACY2P9J7->did not work straight out of the box. the touchscreen just jumped all over with little white dots. spent hours tring to fix with acer via phone. did reinstall hardware. did refresh. still screen jumping so much i could barely click to do a factory reset.  looked online, others had the same reoccurring issue later on. sent back in 2 days. at this price, not too many othet options but will
R13NY4ARB8KKQ6->Very good price performance ratio.
R3Q6L146UC6JO4->One of the best laptops you can get for the price it's worked spectacular! Although the processor is not the fastest it could be upgraded.
R3T152HIZB839R->Bought mine for $230.  Bought another for the gf.  Suggested this to a friend.  We checked and the price had gone UP.  Too weird for tech gear.  Anyhoo that's a good price for a touchscreen notebook in 2015.
R146QG5TGWP6GB->This is the 2nd purchase of this laptop.  I bought the first one  for my grandson for his 21st birthday.  He needed one for college and being the computer whiz he highly recommended it.  So I bought myself one for traveling.  Love the fact that it's so light weight.  It does everything a big computer does!
R10LB2Y811F97X->the product was what I expected
RW7SQAXELGAEU->Love the touchscreen
RBCS5OEOMRN1X->Worked as expected, no problems. Good Price.
R2KHTLSUHEZYHE->Did not have wifi like the information said it would. Returned the item.
R2ZWA9LZ7HRRXL->exelente
R1Q9YSXUJBL21->Got this for my HS senior... Awesome deal!!
R163WHBU8AMZFG->I've owned several laptops over the years and this I would say is the worst. Compete waste of MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!
R3TBH3QJKMJCLO->great product
R2NBLO3M4ZF53S->Work great for my adult kids
R1C9ZF060IQ8JT->I bought this so I could stick it in a bag and use when I go out to set up routers, access points, etc. The screen is very small. I know it is the same size as a tablet but, for some reason, it is much harder to read. This also makes it difficult to touch the correct point. The battery will not hold any charge and I have to plug it in every time I want to use it.  After two weeks of trying, I put it away.  I'll find someone who has no computer to give it to.  I'm sure they will appreciate it but for me, a computer professional, it was a waste of money.
R3G95ESWNN18QQ->Very happy with purchase
R3I5E8O2H0HZLB->It worked fine the first month or two, then every time I start it it would show me a bright black screen and stay there, I had to force it to shut down every time. Plus even when it was working it was so slow. Im so disappointed with this purchase.
R39JS0CV6A7GXN->Simple laptop with the essential features. This is a great product for less demanding people in terms of horsepower. It's great for web browsing, word editing and media consumption. The touchscreen is a nice addition.
R3LSMXXH8XDFJL->Truly excellent value. I went back for 2 more.
R2NFJYH7V0PL08->Does the job has all the inputs I wanted and had trouble finding on other computers. I still would like to get a tablet
R34NK8NGO51AK2->There seems to be a glitch.the screen sometimes goes blank and blinks
R10CCQFTHPMC1D->the best in its class!!
ROF7QWS4NWNHQ->great product. worth the money
RG84A7GPLDU1C->peice of s*** keeps freezing up. its super slow, ive only had it one month.  Dont waste your money
R1S89M6VKDVWEQ->This computer is perfect. I am an online student. It does everything I need for a great price. When I'm not studying it's playing movies or games on low settings. For the price you can't beat it. I'll never buy an apple product again.
RG7VE4U97O42G->Absolutely what I excepted I got, my ASUS IS FABULOUS..... Highly recommended, to any one looking into a laptop-touch screen!
R1E7YT7PANM2AE->Don't waste ur $ its slow invest more so u can get one that works well
R97B7YLMFTFFR->I've had this for about a month and I'm very happy with it. Excellent purchase for the price. I'm not a gamer, so I can not give any info on that, but I've had no issues streaming anything from Netflix, Hulu, You tube, etc. I suspect many of the other people that complained of that may have actually been experiencing issues with their internet service as opposed to their laptop. The touch screen works great, though I only use it for a few things. The keyboard size is fine with me, but it has a few things I would prefer to be changed (mostly with the function keys and the lack of a light on the caps lock button, personal preferences). I really wasn't crazy about the texture of the exterior when I first got it, but I don't even notice it now.
R3T0MLTJDOGF8B->None
R2YTGUF0XMXYQM->Working fine so far.
R1NH5YDQNMH1W0->Previously posted a good review on this, and I stand by what I said.  It functions well, however, the hinges were too tight and one fell off.  The screen is now separated and according to the manufacturer &#34;physical damage,&#34; my fault or not, voids the one year warranty it comes with.  Still a good computer, but I recommend springing for the protection plan (or buying it from Best Buy which has a better protection plan), because the cost of fixing this one little thing is equal to the cost of the computer.
RGW6TLC8731IG->Two days after the return window closed, the screen stopped working. It's completely dark.  I am not amused.
RW81BGKLV7ZCO->Great product, easy to use, lightweight, a little powerhouse!  Fits in most of my purses.  Only downside is the outside casing gets easily scratched.
R15JP1N40MD52D->Fabulous.  Starts up quickly and has all the memory I need.
R2XTVSW923I2MQ->when I got the computer I already loved it the the screen kept on touching its self made me mad but I found out it was just static electricity so I rubbed my super fuzzy blanket over it the wiped down with wet cloth and its been a week but the problem stopped it but its a light small computer easy for transport touchscreen works great speakers are clear and loud
R2B27RP3URHY3->So far so good.  I love this cute PC which is compact and light. Also, I like it more than a tablet.
R790UZANTAT21->The computer is beautiful but there is a big issue with the windows licence, that they didn't toll you in nowhere, they has already perinstal windows, and they did not gave to you the licence code, which means that if you want to format your computer, you must to boy a new windows licence, otherwise it will not work at all
R11H8TCTVA65HR->quite good
R81AC1HWBKGVS->Good
RYM56NTGJ5WDG->None
R2L1WKRZCX0EQ7->This is my travel laptop and works just fine for the light duty work and entertainment while in the airport or in a hotel room.  Do heavier computing on my desktop.
RH2904QQZDU8Y->I DON'T NORMALLY LEAVE FEEDBACK, BUT IN THIS CASE IT IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST BECAUSE AMAZON AND ASUS PROVIDED ME WITH TOP-NOTCH SERVICE!  I AM 100% SATISFIED! I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT IN OCTOBER OF 2014.  BY MARCH OF 2015, THE UNIT WOULD NOT POWER ON COMPLETELY.  THE ASUS EMBLEM WOULD SHOW BRIEFLY, THEN DISAPPEAR.  THE SCREEN WAS BLANK BUT I COULD SEE THAT IT WAS BACKLIT.  ALL I COULD SEE WAS MY CURSER AND THE ADJUSTMENT'S TO LIGHTENING OR DARKENING THE SCREEN, TURNING THE AIRPLANE MODE OFF AND ON, ETC. I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE BY EMAIL.  THEY RESPONDED PROMPTLY WITH AN INFORMATIVE EMAIL WITH ALL THEY LINKS AND PHONE NUMBERS I NEEDED CLEARLY LISTED. I CALLED ASUS, FOLLOWED THE PROMPTS AND SPOKE TO A VERY PLEASANT, KNOWLEDGABLE AND PROFESSIONAL YOUNG LADY NAMED NATALIE WHO LISTENED CAREFULLY TO MY EXPLANATION OF MY PROBLEM, TOOK MY LAPTOP'S SERIAL NUMBER AND MODEL NUMBER (IT'S ON THE BACK OF THE LAPTOP) THEN PROCEEDED TO HELP ME TO RESET THE LAPTOP.  I LOST ANY DATA I DIDN'T BACK UP (LESSON LEARNED) IN THE PROCESS, BUT MY LAPTOP WAS UP AND RUNNING AGAIN AS SOON AS THE RESET WAS COMPLETE (IT TOOK A WHILE SO SHE HAD ME PLUG THE UNIT INTO THE WALL). SHE ASKED IF I HAD RECENTLY DOWNLOADED ANYTHING FROM THERE INTERNET, WHICH I HAD -- AN APP FROM THE STORE WHICH DID NOT WORK PROPERLY --  SHE EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM WAS THAT MALWARE SOMETIMES ATTACH TO THESE AND THAT HAVING GOOD MALWARE PROTECTION IS A MUST. I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH BEFORE PURCHASING THIS LAPTOP AND BASED MY CHOICE ON THE FACT THAT ASUS SCORED THE HIGH RATINGS IN CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PRODUCT  SATISFACTION.  THEY DID NOT LET ME DOWN. MY RECOMMENDATION IS BUY THIS PRODUCT.  I LOVE IT.
R3KNUDFSZ3CJST->None
R1AEK81U4MGLCQ->Great laptop for the price tag. I am a college student who was really just looking for a computer to type my papers on, internet surf and watch the occasional movie. This computer is perfect for my needs. I have also run power point and adobe which operate great as well. I open multiple pages at a time without a problem. I would highly recommend this computer to a friend.
R1XRHFH6PZY2ZM->Nice computer for the money. Great deal!
R10COD0KYARVYJ->My wife loves the touch screen.  She doesn't like computers in general as she's always using her phone or iPad to surf and Facebook.  But that changed when I bought her this for Christmas.
R37EAPJRB4DT91->None
R3HYW6DYBB5BYK->None
R38WVMNCGX4ADY->Really nice notebook! Sounds a little sketchy when you have it on max but otherwise good notebook.
R26MF4Y9RDM1XD->It is a great laptop in this price range. Bought it for my cousin who is still in school and wanted a budget laptop. Nothing fancy about this laptop but it is worth the money. Did not have any complain about it as of now.
R1YE2CS3YWUKNO->I bought this laptop because my primary laptop-a Mac-is very old and heavy and not practical for the level of commuting I do on a daily basis. I needed something smaller and lighter, but only really for general word processing, project generating, and browsing the internet, for work and school. This Asus so far has been perfect!! It has been very easy to take along wherever I go and to pull out in class if needed, and I love it so much it's the computer I use at home as well! Of course, it doesn't have a lot of memory (though I believe it's upgradable), but that wasn't a factor for me. I can have multiple tabs open and be streaming a video and it holds up just fine! It also boots up really quickly and is really easy to use (I know a lot of people have complaints about Windows 8, and I have been a Mac user for awhile now-but I have no problems as of yet). I definitely recommend it, especially for students (that don't need to run large programs), or commuters.
R25ZZAR86NSNSO->great
REOP6U1JIAG23->not bad
R3VTI2H50O0C19->None
R2RI9R01GCX0M6->Amazing price for the feature set in this jazzed up netbook. Would be nice if it came with a basic Word processor, though. Can't really complain though - USBs, HDMI, decent battery life, nice touch screen.
R2XVT7J8ZFVJ6M->Met expectations. Mainly got it so I could write, and works great. Love that you can split the screen.
R2RK2I5AZWUGHG->I wanted a small laptop to travel with, it works great.
R13L5AC6YEDXII->None
R3VKXKURTFS2ZV->There is no user-side battery removal. Weird and irritating unadvertised feature ... Otherwise a decent travel notebook.
RBQTHBR9LZKRB->I found this product very useful. It is best match for this price. The speed could be a little bit more.
RQFQIBE9O8LL8->So far so good. LOVE LOVE LOVE this little computer. The only issue I'm having is that the mouse pad seems cheap but not a deal breaker. I'm surprised at how much I love the touch screen.
R36P4DPDOCBDPO->This tablet is light years ahead of my old tablet. As a non-techie, I have to rely on the products I purchase to make the world of computers and the internet, easy and accessible. The ASUS K-200 does that and more. It is fast and the detachable keyboard is easy to use. The larger screen with Windows 8, makes work or play a snap. This is a lot of product and technology for the price.
R12YFU1803T6O9->The default font size is too small for me, and can't be enlarged. I believe this is true of all Windows 8 tablets. I returned it.
R1PLCYU10EIY65->This PC froze during its auto updates. It got stuck on the "Working on features" screen at 100%. I had to factory reset this laptop twice already and each time it gets stuck during updates. I can't do anything when it gets stuck like this except restart it, but when I do, it goes right back to the frozen update screen. It's useless. There's been something wrong with it since I bought it. Very disappointed.
RG9CXG87F6Z2Q->None
