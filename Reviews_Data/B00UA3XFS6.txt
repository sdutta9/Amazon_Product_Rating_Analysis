RBLG6L9PRBERQ->This is a decent laptop for the price. The Cpu is powerful enough to handle all the works for daily use. The keyboard is nice and clean. The screen images are clean and sharp. The touch pad is excellent.
R33T78VNOACB6H->Love this laptop. I'm an artist and I use this with my designing software and also to show clients completed work.
R1UMUHDPDNM40C->The Dell Premium Tech Support is heads and shoulders above the rest.  I have two Dells now, the newest being a laptop and the other an all in one PC.  I could not believe how far tech support has gone for me - even calling me back to see if everything worked out for me.  Now just make sure that you have the full first year Premium Tech Support - I found out that mine came with only 90 days and it took some talking and they agreed to a full year.  Then when I found out how good the tech support was I purchased an additional 3 years.  Now personally I do not care for Windows 8 nor will I have anything to do with McAfee.  My Dell Tech support ran Super Anti Spyware Free edition of course and Hit Man Pro again free version when I was hit hard with viruses or what ever.  Now I run at lease one of these daily and haven't had any problems since.
R30UINDTPKHHLP->Very fast and for the price it's great for AUTOCAD. Don't really use the touchscreen all that often but seems to work fine.
