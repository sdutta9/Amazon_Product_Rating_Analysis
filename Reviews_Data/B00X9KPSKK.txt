R3CJ0F2OMUX3YE->None
RKUTBGDI6M37C->It's okay. It gets the job done. It's not something I would recommend to anyone who actually has to do lots on the computer. It freezes and crashes constantly and it is impossible to play any games on it. It would be nice for school if it didnt freeze so much.
RF20CW9B2GQMT->A bit bulkier than expected. Screen resolution is quite low. But good value overall.

R1HSU1VUAST8EX->HP x360 is a very confusing array of choices and HP's lack of detail and clarity are to blame.  This leads to alot of frustration trying to sort out their x360 models. You have the Pavilion models, Spectre models, and Envy, etc.  But even within one model range, you have various configurations of CPU, screen,etc. (In fact for the laptop on this screen, the current Amazon listing doesn't even have minimal specs, for instance you cannot tell what the screen resolution is.  I later found out from laptopmag that it's 1366 x 768 for both 11.6 and 13.3 screens.  The 13.3&#34; with 1366x768 is a pretty low pixel density.) HP needs to use varying model numbers, letters, or other CLEAR identifiers in order to keep things sorted out.  Otherwise customers will quickly be confused by all the offerings which may differ by only the CPU installed, which makes a huge difference.  Even on Amazon some of HP x360, item numbers are either nonsensical, having nothing to do with the specs of the unit (M1X24UA#ABA) or listings like this one that have no model number at all  HP  Pavilion x360 2-in-1 13.3-Inch Touchscreen Laptop - Intel Core  i3-5010U/ 4GB Memory/ 500GB HDD/ Webcam/Windows 8.1/Silver .  Only for some HP Pavilion 13-s128nr x360 13.3-Inch (item model numbers 13-s128nr x360 or 13-s120nr x360) do you approach a measure of sanity in numbering. It can be really hard to compare x360 to other laptops, and even harder to compare x360 models to each other. Take this laptop for example  Newest Model HP Pavilion x360 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop (11.6-inch HD IPS Touch-Screen, Intel Quad-Core Pentium N3700 processor, 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD, Windows 10) : Description:  Socket: FCBGA1170, Clockspeed: 1.6 GHz, Turbo Speed: 2.4 GHz, No of Cores: 4, Max TDP: 6 W Other names:  Intel(R) Pentium(R) CPU N3700 @ 1.60GHz CPU First Seen on Charts:  Q2 2015 CPUmark/$Price:  7.60  Overall Rank:  1073 ***AVERAGE CPU MARK 1824 *** Compare to the similar model here  HP  Pavilion x360 2-in-1 13.3-Inch Touchscreen Laptop - Intel Core  i3-5010U/ 4GB Memory/ 500GB HDD/ Webcam/Windows 8.1/Silver : Intel Core i3-5010U @ 2.10GHz  + Compare Average CPU Mark Description:  Clockspeed: 2.1 GHz, No of Cores: 2 (2 logical cores per physical), Max TDP: 15 W Other names:  Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-5010U CPU @ 2.10GHz CPU First Seen on Charts:  Q1 2015 CPUmark/$Price:  NA  Overall Rank:  703 Last Price Change:  NA ***AVERAGE CPU MARK: 3062 *** It's not really clear how this current Amazon listing page for this product being reviewed is different from the others listed above.  This laptop here at Amazon is ASIN B00X9KPSKK.  The other two above are B00UVXJEUS (the other maybe identical 13.3 inch with Core i3-5010U), and B016D03S18 (the 11.6 inch model). You should always go to cpubenchmark.net and enter the CPU of the laptop you are thinking about getting.  The trade offs all start based on how fast the CPU is and how much memory it has.  So the Pentium N3540 in this model with a TDP of 7.5w is consuming half the max power of the other processor at 15w.  And the N3540 has a slightly faster clock speed and four cores instead of two.  But this does not tell the complete story.  The CPU MARK for the N3560 shows it performs at 66% of the faster one.  And there is a tradeoff between overall CPU processing speed and battery life.  But it does not necessarily mean that you get 2x or even 1.3x the battery life of the Core i3-5010U in the other laptop.  And because HP does not list battery life comparisons for various x360 models on their own website or on Amazon, you are left to continue sleuthing which is crazy in the era of big data, analytics, and the world at your fingertips via the Internet. Laptopmag says this of another x360 sibling (with a 2.17-GHz Intel Pentium N3520 Processor)  &#34;You won't get much use out of the HP Pavilion x360 without a charger handy. The notebook lasted 3 hours and 43 minutes on our battery test (Web surfing over Wi-Fi at 100 nits). This endurance falls short of the K200MA (5:23), Yoga 2 11 (5:19) and NB15t (4:07), which all failed to live up to the 7:45 category average.&#34; Laptopmag says of an x360 i3-5010U (2nd model in comparison above?)  &#34;The Pavilion x360 13t has pretty good staying power for its price. This convertible lasted 6 hours and 56 minutes on the Laptop Mag Battery Test (continuous Web surfing over Wi-Fi at 100 nits), which is better than the TP300 (6:12) and the Inspiron 15 (4:46). The HP also beat the budget 2-in-1 average (6:17)&#34;  (Note that the model number of &#34;x360 13t&#34; does not appear anywhere in the HP Amazon listing.  We are guessing we have a match based on the screen size and CPU.) Techradar, speaking of a [?newer] x360 model says &#34;Users will also be able to configure the 11.6-inch HP Pavilion x360 with a fanless Intel Core M chip for $499 (about ÂŁ334, AU$646), which HP promises will deliver eight hours of battery life. &#34;  I could not tell which x360 this is because none of the Amazon HP x360 product listings say 'Core M' and the review did not refer to any x360 model number. HP needs to be consistent in clearly distinguishing the features of the zoo of x360 offerings.  This is something that manufacturers like HP can no longer ignore.  A model number should include the main specs of the laptop.  Otherwise you risk picking a laptop that does not meet YOUR specific needs.  And the HP website is no better.  Although you can see some model numbers there.  If you click on 'See all offers' on the x360 page using either Chrome or IE, nothing happens. But besides clearer product numbering and model naming, HP and the entire industry need to come to a kind of *** truth in labeling *** when it comes to price and performance.  Most product pages for laptops do not clearly talk about battery life.  If you can get talk time and standby time for every mobile phone you should be able to get some kind of standard battery and performance specs for computers and tablets. In the photography world there is a CIPA standard for battery life in cameras.  There needs to be a similar standard here for battery life for laptops, tablets, and phones and all manufacturers need to use it.  Maybe something like PerfLife = batteryLifeAtBenchmarkSettings * standardPerformanceBenchmark
RCKIQ7A7TDG06->None
R371VYY6EMBI50->Very happy with the laptop.  Delivery was on time.
R2XGDBMXGIUIS1->None
R24EXPNFVIYZ33->First, I did not buy my HP laptop from Amazon; I got it at a retailer.  Having said that, it's still an HP so this review is still valid.  The problem with most reviews is they are given within a very short time after receiving the product.  Well, I've had my HP for over 2 years now, and it has been 6 good months followed by 18 of the worst technology-related months of my life.  At about 6 months the screen started flickering--not every once in awhile, but so much that the screen seems to go dark from it, and I'm sure if I was prone to seizures I would be sitting in a mansion paid for by HP.  I found the problem when one of the hinge covers finally popped off on its own.  There is a cable by the left hinge that must be getting pinched, because I can stick a mechanical pencil in there and jiggle the wire and it stops for a bit.  Also, since about 6 months after purchase, the computer started lagging and freezing; sometimes the mouse freezes or the cursor completely disappears from the screen.  Sometimes it comes back on its own and sometimes I have to do a hard shut down and turn it back on.  Also, since about 6 months in the trackpad's two-finger gestures don't work about 25% of the time.  More recently, I have been getting the &#34;plugged in, not charging&#34; message.  HP seems to be competing with Comcast for worst customer service as well.  Basically, I wouldn't recommend an HP brand flashlight, let alone a laptop or tablet from them.  It's a shame, because they used to be great.  Now they are just living off their name recognition and selling the same Chinese-manufactured crap as everyone else.  I wish I could afford a new laptop, but I'm stuck with this garbage for now.  My next purchase (when I'm able to afford it) will be an Asus, or I'll see how the new Microsoft Surface Book does.
