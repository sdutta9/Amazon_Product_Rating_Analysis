Which means I will start writing somewhere else then when I want to be writing. No matter how hard I try not to touch the mouse pad with my hand it makes no difference. I have barely used this laptop and the letters on the keys are already starting to wear off. And to add to the lousy experience the keys are not sensitive at all. Sometimes I have to press the key 2-3 times before it will register. I type 45WPM and it throws off my momentum. I am a writer and I bought this laptop for writing and doing programming. Unless you don't have much money or you only check e-mail or something, I would pass on this laptop. I will never buy this model again ever. I wouldn't pay even 100 bucks for this laptop I hate it that much. On the plus side, the battery lasts a good 4-6 hours. It has a sturdy construction, I have dropped it a few times. It has a good hinge system. The laptop responds well enough in terms of performance. It came with 8GB of RAM which is plenty for me. And it came with a 1TB HDD which I have only used about 200GB of. Oh, the LCD panel is protected by a flimsy shell and that is not a good feature in a laptop. \n",

Now just make sure that you have the full first year Premium Tech Support - I found out that mine came with only 90 days and it took some talking and they agreed to a full year. Then when I found out how good the tech support was I purchased an additional 3 years. Now personally I do not care for Windows 8 nor will I have anything to do with McAfee. My Dell Tech support ran Super Anti Spyware Free edition of course and Hit Man Pro again free version when I was hit hard with viruses or what ever.

I missed the fact that it doesn't have a DVD player when I read the description. On one occasion the screen had a lite pink background instead of white, but at the next startup it was gone. This was my first laptop and the thing that irritates me the most may be common on laptops. Every time I turned it on the number pad would not work until I pushed the Num Lock key. There is not a light on it, like on the Caps Lock key, so I didn't know if the keys were on or off until I pushed a number. I can't see any reason for the number pad to default to the off position when the laptop is shut off. If there is a reason, I don't know what it could be. As far as I'm concerned it's a pain in the Butt. I would rather have a laptop without the key pad rather then wonder whether or not it is going to work. Maybe it's a minor irritation to some, but it's a major one to me. By the way, I typed this review on my desk top, that happens to be a Dell, where  the number pad always works. \n",

      "I cannot tell you how much I regret this purchase. The Inspiron is a catastrophe. On a very basic level of function it has the worst keyboard I've ever seen on a computer. The individual keys are bizarrely small and separated from each other by wide strips of plastic; it is almost impossible to type. I exclusively use an external keyboard. The mousepad is unresponsive even at the highest sensitivity and the mousepad click keys are almost totally useless. Nor can it perform even the most basic tasks of home computing. Since I received this computer I have downloaded a total of two programs: Google Chrome and Avast Antivirus. In other words it is practically in out-of-the-box condition. yet even so it runs far more slowly than my old laptop it was designed to replace, a seven-year-old Dell Latitude with only about 10 open megabytes on its hard drive and whose cooling fan broke years ago. The Inspiron sometimes takes several minutes even to open the Chrome browser. It is a source of almost indescribable frustration. I hate it. I almost never review products. I felt that I had to do anything possible to save others from throwing money away like this. I'm going to have to buy another new computer now because the Inspiron is just utterly worthless even for the extremely light home computing tasks I need it to perform. Please learn from my experience. \n",

Also, the Waves Maxx Radio is great, very precise sounds. Physically, the laptop is sturdy and the keyboard is made of extremely high quality materials (finger stains are really easy to clean up), and the silver finish adds to the aesthetics. The Full HD 1080P is also a plus of this laptop. Pros: Touchscreen, FULL HD 1080P, Lots of Ram, great audio, good quality materials, very sturdy, excellent Dell Support, Glossy Screen. Cons: The battery life is very short. Just basic web browsing barely got me 4 hours on a full charge. With Netflix and some Youtube videos, I was struggling to have it last 2 hours on a full charge. I expected the battery on a modern laptop with these specs will give me at least 7 to 8 hours. The price is extremely high for an i5 laptop. \n",

The computer itself is ok. It's big and bulky, the keyboard is very nice (keys have a nice feel). You can't open a single office doc without purchasing (or leasing the app) office which I think is bs (word or excel docs won't open in any type of reader), I think that's kind of crappy, don't know if that's a stripped down software issue from Dell (I knew I wasn't getting a lot of bells/whistles at this price) or a Microsoft deal - either way it sucks.
