R3CJ0F2OMUX3YE->This is a general post about HP Customer support. I've had an HP for 4 years which I have taken really good care of both in equipment, upgrades and protection from viruses and malware. It still works fine and more powerful than some new models.  I had an issue with a Windows upgrade that corrupted my boot sector requiring an original installation disc to repair. Since my PC came preloaded I contacted HP to obtain an original installation disc. They declined to assist me saying my pc was 4 years old and obsolete. I'm sorry it is up to me to determine whether it still has a useful life. I reminded them that they are still selling PCs that are less equipped than mine with Windows 7 as the OS and that I just wanted the disc they owed me.  Nevertheless, they refused.  This is not customer service in any fashion. I now, in good conscience could never recommend HP as as a company to do business with.  Good companies take care of their customers when they can not make excuses why they will not.  They have lost my business forever!  BUYERS BEWARE.
RKUTBGDI6M37C->It's okay. It gets the job done. It's not something I would recommend to anyone who actually has to do lots on the computer. It freezes and crashes constantly and it is impossible to play any games on it. It would be nice for school if it didnt freeze so much.
RF20CW9B2GQMT->A bit bulkier than expected. Screen resolution is quite low. But good value overall.
R32PVB5R2ZZ0C4->Excellent product excellent price And gr&eacute;\ucc3dt service I recommend tour organisation &Agrave;+++++++
R2UV5LHA886UR7->This is the worst laptop I have ever used. It runs incredibly slow even though I purchased this two weeks ago and I only run a few programs at a time. For example, it freezes when I use Firefox and Outlook and that's it. The cursor disappears. The touchpad is not responsive at all so you have to click something three times for it to go through finally. The volume turns itself up and down by itself. Sometimes the laptop tells me that the battery life will last 346 hours. The Wifi capability is horrible and it will not connect to your Wifi unless you are sitting right next to the modem/router.\nI would return this in a heartbeat if I could.
R1HSU1VUAST8EX->HP x360 is a very confusing array of choices and HP's lack of detail and clarity are to blame.  This leads to alot of frustration trying to sort out their x360 models. You have the Pavilion models, Spectre models, and Envy, etc.  But even within one model range, you have various configurations of CPU, screen,etc. (In fact for the laptop on this screen, the current Amazon listing doesn't even have minimal specs, for instance you cannot tell what the screen resolution is.  I later found out from laptopmag that it's 1366 x 768 for both 11.6 and 13.3 screens.  The 13.3&#34; with 1366x768 is a pretty low pixel density.) HP needs to use varying model numbers, letters, or other CLEAR identifiers in order to keep things sorted out.  Otherwise customers will quickly be confused by all the offerings which may differ by only the CPU installed, which makes a huge difference.  Even on Amazon some of HP x360, item numbers are either nonsensical, having nothing to do with the specs of the unit (M1X24UA#ABA) or listings like this one that have no model number at all  HP  Pavilion x360 2-in-1 13.3-Inch Touchscreen Laptop - Intel Core  i3-5010U/ 4GB Memory/ 500GB HDD/ Webcam/Windows 8.1/Silver .  Only for some HP Pavilion 13-s128nr x360 13.3-Inch (item model numbers 13-s128nr x360 or 13-s120nr x360) do you approach a measure of sanity in numbering. It can be really hard to compare x360 to other laptops, and even harder to compare x360 models to each other. Take this laptop for example  Newest Model HP Pavilion x360 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop (11.6-inch HD IPS Touch-Screen, Intel Quad-Core Pentium N3700 processor, 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD, Windows 10) : Description:  Socket: FCBGA1170, Clockspeed: 1.6 GHz, Turbo Speed: 2.4 GHz, No of Cores: 4, Max TDP: 6 W Other names:  Intel(R) Pentium(R) CPU N3700 @ 1.60GHz CPU First Seen on Charts:  Q2 2015 CPUmark/$Price:  7.60  Overall Rank:  1073 ***AVERAGE CPU MARK 1824 *** Compare to the similar model here  HP  Pavilion x360 2-in-1 13.3-Inch Touchscreen Laptop - Intel Core  i3-5010U/ 4GB Memory/ 500GB HDD/ Webcam/Windows 8.1/Silver : Intel Core i3-5010U @ 2.10GHz  + Compare Average CPU Mark Description:  Clockspeed: 2.1 GHz, No of Cores: 2 (2 logical cores per physical), Max TDP: 15 W Other names:  Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-5010U CPU @ 2.10GHz CPU First Seen on Charts:  Q1 2015 CPUmark/$Price:  NA  Overall Rank:  703 Last Price Change:  NA ***AVERAGE CPU MARK: 3062 *** It's not really clear how this current Amazon listing page for this product being reviewed is different from the others listed above.  This laptop here at Amazon is ASIN B00X9KPSKK.  The other two above are B00UVXJEUS (the other maybe identical 13.3 inch with Core i3-5010U), and B016D03S18 (the 11.6 inch model). You should always go to cpubenchmark.net and enter the CPU of the laptop you are thinking about getting.  The trade offs all start based on how fast the CPU is and how much memory it has.  So the Pentium N3540 in this model with a TDP of 7.5w is consuming half the max power of the other processor at 15w.  And the N3540 has a slightly faster clock speed and four cores instead of two.  But this does not tell the complete story.  The CPU MARK for the N3560 shows it performs at 66% of the faster one.  And there is a tradeoff between overall CPU processing speed and battery life.  But it does not necessarily mean that you get 2x or even 1.3x the battery life of the Core i3-5010U in the other laptop.  And because HP does not list battery life comparisons for various x360 models on their own website or on Amazon, you are left to continue sleuthing which is crazy in the era of big data, analytics, and the world at your fingertips via the Internet. Laptopmag says this of another x360 sibling (with a 2.17-GHz Intel Pentium N3520 Processor)  &#34;You won't get much use out of the HP Pavilion x360 without a charger handy. The notebook lasted 3 hours and 43 minutes on our battery test (Web surfing over Wi-Fi at 100 nits). This endurance falls short of the K200MA (5:23), Yoga 2 11 (5:19) and NB15t (4:07), which all failed to live up to the 7:45 category average.&#34; Laptopmag says of an x360 i3-5010U (2nd model in comparison above?)  &#34;The Pavilion x360 13t has pretty good staying power for its price. This convertible lasted 6 hours and 56 minutes on the Laptop Mag Battery Test (continuous Web surfing over Wi-Fi at 100 nits), which is better than the TP300 (6:12) and the Inspiron 15 (4:46). The HP also beat the budget 2-in-1 average (6:17)&#34;  (Note that the model number of &#34;x360 13t&#34; does not appear anywhere in the HP Amazon listing.  We are guessing we have a match based on the screen size and CPU.) Techradar, speaking of a [?newer] x360 model says &#34;Users will also be able to configure the 11.6-inch HP Pavilion x360 with a fanless Intel Core M chip for $499 (about ÂŁ334, AU$646), which HP promises will deliver eight hours of battery life. &#34;  I could not tell which x360 this is because none of the Amazon HP x360 product listings say 'Core M' and the review did not refer to any x360 model number. HP needs to be consistent in clearly distinguishing the features of the zoo of x360 offerings.  This is something that manufacturers like HP can no longer ignore.  A model number should include the main specs of the laptop.  Otherwise you risk picking a laptop that does not meet YOUR specific needs.  And the HP website is no better.  Although you can see some model numbers there.  If you click on 'See all offers' on the x360 page using either Chrome or IE, nothing happens. But besides clearer product numbering and model naming, HP and the entire industry need to come to a kind of *** truth in labeling *** when it comes to price and performance.  Most product pages for laptops do not clearly talk about battery life.  If you can get talk time and standby time for every mobile phone you should be able to get some kind of standard battery and performance specs for computers and tablets. In the photography world there is a CIPA standard for battery life in cameras.  There needs to be a similar standard here for battery life for laptops, tablets, and phones and all manufacturers need to use it.  Maybe something like PerfLife = batteryLifeAtBenchmarkSettings * standardPerformanceBenchmark
RCKIQ7A7TDG06->We're very impressed with this HP.  We bought this HP for our son, since his school requires a laptop with 9 hours of battery life on a single charge.  Wins:  ***********************\n***9+hours of battery life.  So far, charging each night results in a full school day's use.  *****************\n***Super responsive touch screen.  Within a week, he spills soda onto his keyboard, rendering it mostly useless.  Luckily, the touch screen is so responsive, he has been able to use the device without the keyboard.  We bought a USB silicone keyboard for the times when he might need to use the keyboard extensively like for writing essays.  *****************\n***Windows 10 which this model uses is amazing.  My son vocally prefers Windows 10 over OS X Yosemite.  *******\n***Its powerful enough to play Minecraft and other Internet heavy games. ****************\nFails***** So far- NONE!\nWe're very glad to have only paid half the cost of a Macbook Air for the same if not better results.  We also have the full gamut of Mac/Apple products (Macbook Air/Pro, iPads, iPhones, etc.).  We were sorely tempted to spend the extra money on the reliability of Apple, but only the top of the line Macbook might have delivered a full day's charge.  Based on 60 days of school use, my son (and our pocket books) are happily surprised to be very pleased!
R371VYY6EMBI50->Very happy with the laptop.  Delivery was on time.
R2XGDBMXGIUIS1->Happy so far 3 weeks.  Fast delivery.
R24EXPNFVIYZ33->First, I did not buy my HP laptop from Amazon; I got it at a retailer.  Having said that, it's still an HP so this review is still valid.  The problem with most reviews is they are given within a very short time after receiving the product.  Well, I've had my HP for over 2 years now, and it has been 6 good months followed by 18 of the worst technology-related months of my life.  At about 6 months the screen started flickering--not every once in awhile, but so much that the screen seems to go dark from it, and I'm sure if I was prone to seizures I would be sitting in a mansion paid for by HP.  I found the problem when one of the hinge covers finally popped off on its own.  There is a cable by the left hinge that must be getting pinched, because I can stick a mechanical pencil in there and jiggle the wire and it stops for a bit.  Also, since about 6 months after purchase, the computer started lagging and freezing; sometimes the mouse freezes or the cursor completely disappears from the screen.  Sometimes it comes back on its own and sometimes I have to do a hard shut down and turn it back on.  Also, since about 6 months in the trackpad's two-finger gestures don't work about 25% of the time.  More recently, I have been getting the &#34;plugged in, not charging&#34; message.  HP seems to be competing with Comcast for worst customer service as well.  Basically, I wouldn't recommend an HP brand flashlight, let alone a laptop or tablet from them.  It's a shame, because they used to be great.  Now they are just living off their name recognition and selling the same Chinese-manufactured crap as everyone else.  I wish I could afford a new laptop, but I'm stuck with this garbage for now.  My next purchase (when I'm able to afford it) will be an Asus, or I'll see how the new Microsoft Surface Book does.
R78868900->This is the best laptop ever! I'm a full time student, a development assistant, and attempting to launch a new start-up company. This computer is truly my all in one. It is a multitasking dream. The screen is fully touch and always understands when its in touch screen mode. I was going to buy a cheaper laptop, but decided to a little more money and it was well worth it.
R87687780->Excellent performance for the value.
RGGJGJHG6780->First one would not connect to WiFi . Hp said it was a hardware issue . Second one i got one half of the touch screen doesn't work ...\nAnd now I'm stuck with the second one . Junk . These are obviously refurbished .For now, I give this a 4 star.  I haven't had it long but have had pretty good luck with it.  Problems with the mouse doing things I don't want it to but that could be me.

R3AILL2YTWZFLM->I bought an Acer Aspire R3 2-in-1 that died in 2 weeks, After reading ratings of Acer as a firm, (after the fact) I decided to buy this HP X360 instead based on newly positive reviews of HP and of this model. Positives: nice keyboard feel, good wi-fi reception. Negatives: my impression is that the HP is significantly slower than the Acer, even though both have i3 processors, the same memory and hard drive sizes. The HP also has a less sensitive touch screen, perhaps due to the slightly smaller screen size. Lots more bloatware was preinstalled. I upgraded to Windows 10 with no problems, except that it literally took HOURS over cable wifi, much longer than the Acer. In hindsight, for $100 less, I would risk the Acer again. In fact, if they were the same price, I still would.
R23P4K6IE8Z6VS->Great little laptop!  Only con, the screen is a little small.
R2COMQHZNT25NJ->As soon as I got this computer, I updated to windows 10. 1.  In administrator  mode, it takes a long time to boot to windows or it just hangs. 2.  In user mode, it just hangs as I tried to log in into the account. I am not sure if this is HW issue or SW but since this is a new machine and they claimed it was Windows 10 ready, it should work..

R3RIH068A7Q1YU->Do not buy this from KLAMPs electronics. I'm giving this product a negative review not based on the quality of the unit I received but because the information in the description was misleading. The people who posted the description were either lazy or purposefully dishonest and copy and pasted from a more expensive unit. In the description it states &#34; Horizontal brushing in natural silver With an ash-silver keyboard creates a stylish appearance&#34; and &#34; Full-size, island-style keyboard encased in brushed aluminum enables comfortable typing.&#34; it even shows a silver keyboard in one of the pictures. This is not true it comes with black keys on a black surface. The picture also shows a 10 key on the keyboard of the silver one, this does not have a 10 key. The description also states it has an &#34;Antiglare finish allows easy viewing in bright light&#34; It is not anti glare. It was confusing having pictures of 2 obviously different machines so I looked to the description to help make a decision, incorrectly assuming that information in the description would be correct. I would have bought another laptop (for less money with the same features) had I known the truth. hope this helps someone make a better decision.
