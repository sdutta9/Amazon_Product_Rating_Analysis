R4B6SKXN0C5CV->Did not meet my expectations! Will not run my scanner or even recognize it No DVDs player so can not load my scanner program Seems slow to respond to keyboard inputs. I would return it but lost my receipt
RUXE1YNFVK11H->I was definitely concerned about buying a refurbished computer, but I was reassured by the warranty and return window, and this computer works beautifully.  I will say there was some initial bugs to work out with it, just simple stuff, and I did have to buy an external CD drive to install my Office.  But, having worked out those things, I can't say enough what a great laptop this is.  After bad experiences with other computer brands, I swore I would never buy anything other than Dell again, even though they are more expensive, because Dell computers work for years.  It's a fast computer and it's just like having a clean, brand new one at a much lower cost than if I bought a new Dell.  I would buy it again!
R1JMWL7TPB30D5->awful.  complete garbage.
RTBVZHROBAZYE->A good buy for the money. Nothing fancy but it runs well enough for it's purpose and was inexpensive,
R12ASJQM85412R->this is perfect for grandchildren. works really good and has full dell warrantee.
R9X7DW8T5BA7Q->It does not have a place to put the CD
R1BUD4P3JG6ZJ->Not bad for the price.  Performance a little sluggish.
R2MZ8IPYN96CB->the packaging was terrible. No instructions, no cds for installation, nothing.
RI7YLM7C5Q176->Computer worked for 60 or so days and then died.
RTANISX5YMS6G->I just got it yesterday and its good but it won't charge. i left it on charger and later i check on it and its still didin't charge at all it keep saying 0% available (plugged in, charging) I don't know how to get to charge
R3DQNX00VG7VOZ->100% RECOMENDABLE
R1IALNUU320PR->Compact design and decent performance if you only want to run ofimatic software.
R1734M4G1DTOVH->Fully satisfied.
R2FQ9245SMX9BJ->Refurbished
R2OD0R6R6F3VCZ->Thankyou To All You That Make Possible This Shopping  ,I Am Very Happy With My Laptop It Fulfilled All My expectations
R224IEA00QZKGP->Nice computer, thin, light, and fast.  I hate that it doesn't have a cd drive. It comes with backup discs in case I have to reset it. But how am I supposed to load the program's if I can't insert the discs? Also came without the sound drive installed, so it took me awhile how to figure out how to get it fixed.
R58AYO17LXZHU->I was disappointed there was no Cd/DVD player, only one space for a memory board, and limited ports. The computer came with a CD for Windows 8 butt I had to purchase an external player. My computer &#34;guru&#34; was also surprised. Instead of being able to add memory I had to purchase one with twice as much memory and replace the one already installed. With the other upgrades I now have the laptop will serve me well.
R3RJM6WJZ1HO96->Way too hard to get used to.
R2AKPL904O0SXC->Bought this for my daughter at an amazing low price for the spec. Thought it would take me all day to set-up and get used to Windows 8.1, as I'm on 7, expected to have to read through normal thick manual, etc. but Windows 8.1 is truly amazing, as loaded everything automatically, found her Infinity b/band itself, etc. etc. Whole set-up, start to finish was less than 2 hours. The laptop works like a new computer, very fast and stable. So if you are hesitating about buying this, because of fear of being refurbished, then don't worry!!
R2POMGMWUACTU6->Great laptop with an affordable price. I enjoyed it very much and used it every day. The battery life is pretty good, too. Recommend it.
R2RURZRC5HEQXN->This laptop is fantastic value for money is very fast and ideal for everyday tasks. All in All it is a great laptop! I'm glad I made this purchase. First I got a great price. Second unlike a lot of the reviews said this computer has no speed issues. I don't notice it being slow at all. When I click on something is appears just as you would expect. It has really high quality just like a new computer.
R32DURIIB9OEWC->Nice laptop with all the tech specs I need. Its a refurbished model. However, so far I havent got any sign of wear. Really a new look and it works like a new one with no problem.
RWFEXKPIVLNZX->Considering this computer didn't have an internal fan to help cool it down, it easily became broken and screwed up the motherboard. Unfortunately, I waited too long to get it in to be checked out, so now I can't return it. Dell is a good computer company, but this model isn't. Honestly I'm quite disappointed.
R3RZ9EIK3TCAF9->did not meet my needs,  could not connect to internet.  no cd/dvd drive
R756KIGYL17ML->Extremely slow.  Bought this because my screen broke on similar model which worked great.  This is the first and last refurbished Dell I will ever buy.
R1RV89ZYCTUYBX->arrived, the battery did not charge at all seems to be a known issue.
R2L46MDQO9Q01R->Great value......bought it for my son, but was tempted to get another one for myself!  Plenty of storage and fast enough for 80% of computer users; it has a big screen and it's light and slim compared to others in it's class.  The one I bought was a certified repaired pre-owned, but so far no issues.  I downloaded the free versions of malware bytes and Apache Office Suite for him to use at school. Shipped and delivered as expected.  Home run!!!!!
R2Q6M9S4EL4Q9E->It's all around a good laptop especially considering the price. It's very nice when it come to graphics as style of the laptop itself. It works great aside from the fact that the processor might be lacking. Unfortunately the processor is not as powerful as it could or should be in my opinion but you get what you pay for. In the end this laptop is good and I would recommend it to an everyday user.
RQRPGABZU101X->The computer performed a little slower than I expected. I know it is really cheap, but overall pretty slow. I don't think I would buy again.
R6WHT6E61DEG3->Great Productos
R19Q620DBDA0IP->Very disappointed
R3KJ4T80SI06FL->the machine is wrong, the keyboard keys are changed, I'll return. it doesn '' T work
R2O13ZWRQYWB0W->The Dell XPS Laptop is the WORST computer I've ever had. Less than one year of owning it & it freezes at least 1x/every day. The BSOD of death also shows up. There answer was to send it in to their depost and to replace the hardware and reinstall the operating system. All of my files were lost and I had to purchase programs again. Everything from microsoft office to photoshop. Less than 2 weeks after having the laptop back & reinstalling everything it has started freezing again. Dell says that since they fixed it once they say the case is closed. Worst customer service. I used to be a faithful dell customer but now I'm gone.
R2A9U17762Q2OI->This laptop is great. It has a good battery life. Only thing is that disappointing me is that it doesn't have a DVD player. But good overall besides that.
R1QRDS2WPL11CX->Take about an hour to update. It will turn off right in the middle of what I'm doing and update.
R1M035J1A5EIQ1->exellent computer!
R24FW5HSL2D8X5->dell refurbished not same as dell
R36K3Y9LYEMXPC->Great computer, runs fast, battery is pretty good. Had purchased a HP previous to this and hated it for lack of storage and overall performance so I returned it and got this one and don't regret it at all!
R1DD1RN8G3AZ71->This laptop is of such touch-and-go quality that I found it impossible to give it anything above a three-star rating. Although it functions most of the time, you better have a mouse on hand because the TouchPad constantly malfunctions. My numerous other complaints are in regard to the operating system and not the laptop itself.
R34BS6JYFVT7NX->After a year of dealing with my piece-of-crap HP laptop (cheapest one I could find at Walmart - save yourself the pain, DON'T BUY IT), I needed to find myself a new laptop. I have a refurbished Dell Inspiron with an XP system that I use for gaming, and it works beautifully, so I wanted to find a newer Dell for school and everyday use. Praise God, I found this one! The laptop itself is in pristine condition and is installed with Windows 8.1, and... IT RUNS! My biggest complaint about my cheap HP was that it would run slowly and the Internet would freeze at random, so to have a laptop that runs at a very fast speed is an absolute joy. I can also type much faster on the Internet, which I couldn't on my other laptop. This laptop came with a charger and battery and is well worth every penny I paid for it. If you're looking for a good laptop to use for school, work, or everyday, do yourself a favor and buy this little baby!
RSQQQ8LJFRB88->Excelente
RPZFYS473JSNL->Here are the pros as I see them: -The price, the price, the price -The weight is much lighter than my I7 high end laptop -Battery lasts 5-7.5 hours depending on use, many Windows laptops in this price range only last 3 hours so this is a huge advantage. -A large 15.6 inch screen for a great price -This CPU doesn't run hot at all and has decent performance for the price. -Keyboard feels nice and doesn't feel too cheap, we will see with time though how it holds up. -Trackpad works good, buttons are loud when clicked though. -Nice to have a Windows laptop for this price, I like chromebooks but I can't connect to my at home Samba server from a chromebook so I gravitate to Windows.
R1BNDO15TU0YJT->Very good laptop
R1BFZ4VHWHO2TV->I love this laptop,great value for the money.
R2AFTNGFLFUQKF->Great price with great performance! I loved it!
RKFDKZ4RN9BBU->The price is unbeatable for this configuration which is good for daily use. It is not for gamers though
R3HEN0NWZXV9P3->Definitely a great replacement of my old happy. Give me power to surf the web, finish my work, and enjoy the video online. I am thinking someday I will upgrade it for more ram. Anyway, love it. Too bad it is not 'new', :)
R1T754SIN8FVNG->quick shipping, excellent seller with good quality in a unbeatable price, will buy it again.
R2AD4S3Q4E0M15->I like my labtop
R24284SSKSN7UO->Its exactly what I expected & a bit more.
R12HIFHI7AHLR->I like the screen on it but I am really disappointed with the speed. With the specifications, I expected it to be a lot faster. When I play games, it lags really bad and my last computer was cheaper than this and was way faster. I'm not happy with it.
R7H9MTDX92DFH->No dvd player in this model. Didn't know computers came without a dvd drive in them.
R2M7LYCRY4M0W7->Excellent performance, especially given its price point. It's performing very well after several weeks' use and I don't anticipate any trouble given my past experiences with Dell pcs.
RSHY5BTJF3J9F->best laptop under 300reliable.
RE2JHURWZJZJK->That have dvd rider
