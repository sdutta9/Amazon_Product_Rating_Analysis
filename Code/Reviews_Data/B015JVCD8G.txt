R2ABT677JZO6U4->I ordered a touchscreen computer and received a non touch screen NOT a happy customer
R2FJZTPLZZF7FO->Excellent touch desktop
R3F54MSQFSQU6H->Runs a little slow, but it looks nice and I like having a big screen. I'm a very basic computer user (Microsoft Office and Internet, no games) so it serves its purpose for that. The touch screen is cool, but I forget it's an option most of the time. I really like the keyboard and mouse that come with it.
