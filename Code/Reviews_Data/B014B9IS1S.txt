R10A5EO9M8HX11->This is NOT the newest Dell chromebook. BUYER BEWARE. I am returning
R36LXDFJUIGJPQ->I love this chromebook laptop! If you're casually just watching movies, YouTube videos or even your everyday browsing. This is a must have! It's really quick and gets the everyday job done. Pros: Lightweight SSD Built in Mic and Webcam Stylish Cons: I don't have any
R3T6363G2ECJOA->A word of caution! I just received this laptop. While it does indeed appear to have 4GB and a Celeron 2955U processor (based on the chrome://system information), this is NOT the &#34;2015 Newest Dell Chromebook&#34;. That chromebook has a 180 degree hinge and more rugged chassis. This is the 2014 model, as best I can tell. I am very suspicious of this laptop now that they so blatantly lied about its model year. What else is being falsely advertised? I am on the fence about going through the trouble of returning it.
R37IF93KY8CXD8->I wanted to buy a laptop that is not too heavy but can handle my basic entertainment needs. This model is exactly the thing I was looking for. The price is good since this is a refurbished model. It does not have any issue so far and I am totally amazed.
R16JKUBFLEBSDV->This chromebook has a 16gb SSD and I find it really more than enough for me. Although it looks small but I am very pleased with its capacity. Both my sister and I have this model and we both love it.
R3JZPZMUYMH0XT->I like the design and the color of the computer. It has a nice finish. Not heavy at all. I bought it for travel use. Perfect!
