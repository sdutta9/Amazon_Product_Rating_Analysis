R1E1R8QW0G9AK2->I am very impressed with this Asus Notebook. The first thing I did was downloaded Windows 10. It took almost a full day to set it up the way I wanted, but everything is working great.
R2CN11XWXEEZLF->None
R2C3OCMNZR7QSN->I bought this computer as travel help and to take it to the University as an easy going computer, I like it very much, A very light computer , everything works for me, I am from Costa Rica and was kind of concern about buying this brand but I really recommended. I am not an exigent type of person on computers, For giving lessons, emails, some charts and surf on the net, works for me. Speakers 85% , mousepad  90% , you get what you pay for.
R1M6T55H6M9YZI->Did not buy from Amazon but as a long-time Amazon Prime member, I thought it is of value to post a review here.This computer is a piece of junk. It worked ok (nothing great, nothing bad, in the range of what you would expect in the $300 price range) but the battery died 2 months out of warranty. Problem is that the battery is not user replaceable. Which means that the notebook would have to be sent to Asus for repair. Because the unit is 2 months out of warranty, Asus will not cover the repair cost and quoted an estimated cost of $300 to fix it (in addition to the cost of mailing the unit to Asus), i.e. more than what I paid for the computer a little bit more than a year ago and also more to buy a brand-new replacement machine.I recommend to stay clear from this product and Asus in general for the following reasons:- non user replaceable battery- strict adherence to warranty policy even if product fails just outside of warranty- quote to repair is higher than original acquisition cost- I waited a full hour until I was able to speak to a live person
RF7PZ64FMGFGN->Within 2 months I have to constantly restart due to unresponsiveness. I just want to dump it.
R2DNXISQ5WDQ91->Slow processor- okay for price paid thou.
R227VCISIZJ79E->The USB 3 is a real deal! The touchscreen works flawlessly. Had the SSD replacement and it was faster since it came to me as cheap and slow compared to other laptops that I have tried. There's a noise coming from the hard drive. The touch pad also feels cheap.

R96QBCJ0Q68RT->After significant research online (days and days worth) I decided upon this device to use for school. It mostly sits on my coffee table. I carry it to class once a week for the past five weeks. During class a few weeks ago I picked it up to move it about one foot left and I heard something pop. It was a little black cover from the wires that go from the keyboard to the screen. Since that time, the screen has been popping apart at the base in the lower right corner. I finally had to superglue it to make it stop doing that. Given that I barely use this and I rarely travel with it (I take really good care of it) I didn't expect it to fall apart this easily. I'm really disappointed since I fell in love with the Asus Zenbook (through work) and wanted an affordable Asus for home. I'm past the return date, and this kind of thing doesn't show within 30 days so I'm kind of stuck. I guess I'll go with the Chromebook or Acer next time. Lesson learned!

R117Z54AUCRN1Y->very nice laptop. the touchscreen is great.
R1Q44QA4DT2A2H->It's a little slow but decent for the money that I paid for it, still relatively new so hopefully it continues to run decently for the rest of the time I'm in college

R2GTK1G4V9UFTC->Does not live, it brings another revolutionary development of the computer industry. It has a fascinating design, with exciting and powerful. It has changed the relationship between man and computer conventional rigid fundamentally. You are free to take it away from you, close to you, with any of your position, like a sunflower as it makes our digital lives more bright, simple and exciting.

R3EB95I2G7I0WV->Keyboard does not fuction, returning laptop.
RQDWO767LWYPL->Purchased this laptop last year for my wife. Buying another for my son - who uses the wife's all the time. It is a good basic, lightweight touch screen Windows laptop that can handle most everyday activities. My younger son even has Steam downloaded on it and can play many games without complaint - but of course he still wants a Gaming PC.I plan to purchase an SSD and swap out the HDD.  There are videos on youtube that show how to open an X200 laptop - which is the same chassis as this laptop.
R8768730920->Needed to upgrade my netbook and give my old one to my daughter. I really like Asus. I hunted around and finally found this one with a price I could live with. Everything works great. Finally figuring out 8.1 Windows and liking the touch screen and apps. The jack for the sound is the only thing I'm worried about. It's pretty generic plastic and if I don't have the headphones plugged in before I start a program or change a program in the middle, plug or unplug it. Sometimes it turns the sound off for the whole computer and I have to restart. Other than that another win for me with Asus.
R76873478->did not work straight out of the box. the touchscreen just jumped all over with little white dots. spent hours tring to fix with acer via phone. did reinstall hardware. did refresh. still screen jumping so much i could barely click to do a factory reset. looked online, others had the same reoccurring issue later on. sent back in 2 days. at this price, not too many othet options but will
R87877cdy8->Bought mine for $230. Bought another for the gf. Suggested this to a friend. We checked and the price had gone UP. Too weird for tech gear. Anyhoo that's a good price for a touchscreen notebook in 2015.
R87y87h70->Love the touchscreen
R87687iuh->great product
R878yd800->I bought this so I could stick it in a bag and use when I go out to set up routers, access points, etc. The screen is very small. I know it is the same size as a tablet but, for some reason, it is much harder to read. This also makes it difficult to touch the correct point. The battery will not hold any charge and I have to plug it in every time I want to use it. After two weeks of trying, I put it away. I'll find someone who has no computer to give it to. I'm sure they will appreciate it but for me, a computer professional, it was a waste of money.
R87y7h879->The screen is small, but that comes with the design of an ultra-portable notebook.The touchscreen works great, but you don't have to use it if you'd rather stick with the classic mouse(touch pad) and keyboard controls.
R87687y8y->great product. worth the money
R7867y878->I've had this for about a month and I'm very happy with it. Excellent purchase for the price. I'm not a gamer, so I can not give any info on that, but I've had no issues streaming anything from Netflix, Hulu, You tube, etc. I suspect many of the other people that complained of that may have actually been experiencing issues with their internet service as opposed to their laptop. The touch screen works great, though I only use it for a few things. The keyboard size is fine with me, but it has a few things I would prefer to be changed (mostly with the function keys and the lack of a light on the caps lock button, personal preferences). I really wasn't crazy about the texture of the exterior when I first got it, but I don't even notice it now.
R776567gyu->Previously posted a good review on this, and I stand by what I said. It functions well, however, the hinges were too tight and one fell off. The screen is now separated and according to the manufacturer "physical damage," my fault or not, voids the one year warranty it comes with. Still a good computer, but I recommend springing for the protection plan (or buying it from Best Buy which has a better protection plan), because the cost of fixing this one little thing is equal to the cost of the computer.
R767676699->when I got the computer I already loved it the the screen kept on touching its self made me mad but I found out it was just static electricity so I rubbed my super fuzzy blanket over it the wiped down with wet cloth and its been a week but the problem stopped it but its a light small computer easy for transport touchscreen works great speakers are clear and loud
