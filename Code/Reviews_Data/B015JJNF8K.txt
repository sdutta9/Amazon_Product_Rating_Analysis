R3CVIWA4LBVEK3->None
R5NT3RTWE8LHK->This is absolutely perfect for the price paid. It is compact, light and easy to use. The display is good. Very good device for browsing,emailing and watching movies. 5 star to the product. It was delivered the very next day after order, so 5 start to Amazon prime too.

R1U0DY142DXZLY->This is could be a great tablet, but there are problems with the sound.  I cannot get stereo sound in my headphones.  After too many customer service support contacts, I had to send it back to have it repaired.  It came back without Windows 10 (they put it back to Windows 8.1) and the sound worked.  After upgrading to Windows 10 again, the sound worked for about a month.  They want me to send it back again.  I use my tablet a lot when I travel and almost daily at home.  I use it almost exclusively to watch video and without decent sound, this is a worthless device.  Everything else about the tablet is great.  The magnetic dock is strong and I can use it as a laptop--the keyboard is large enough that I can type just as well on it as I can on a full-sized keyboard.  It doesn't tip when the screen is pushed back as other reviews have said and when the screen and keyboard are not docked, it's a great tablet.  This would be a five-star rating if it wasn't for the constant sound problems.

R29NWIQ3D7NW9T->It worked for two days. Now it is a paper weight. I always thoroughly research products because like most people, I have not got money to waste. I never would have bought it based on the reviews that are posted now.

R2Z2FR4BB297UX->I was in the market for a new Netbook when I stumbled across this Gem. I have purchased numerous ACER products, so I fully expected a quality product. What is awesome about this product is that the device may be used as a Netbook, or a tablet. The Windows OS operates flawlessly. The docking keyboard with full sized USB is far superior than what is currently on the market (versus a Bluetooth one). The Price sealed the deal. If you're looking for a Microsoft Surface, scratch that idea, and pick up one of these! It'll save you a significant amount of money, and works better.

R35IU0BE3E20AZ->I've only had it for a few days but I LOVE this cute little thing! I use the keyboard mostly but at times I do like to disconnect it and even put it on the keyboard backwards (It acts as stand).  Before you read my rather lengthy review, I want to first start off by saying that I mainly use my laptop to surf the internet and play a few games such as Candy Crush, etc. (So, no hardcore gamer here). I do spend a large portion of my day on one of my computers.  I have a much larger laptop (HP 19.1&#34;) but it is getting a bit old. Poor thing. I can see me using this MUCH more than that. I also have a HP desktop (I love HP's) and it's super powerful. Of course, I have a Note 5 through Verizon as well. In saying that, I do have some other computers to compare this with and I can see myself using this one above all the others. I will start with a few pro's: -PRICE: I have researched and researched and cannot find anything much cheaper than this that has all the specs (I bought mine at BB on sale). -It is MUCH faster than I anticipated. I have about 4 webpages open now as I'm typing this. -Touchscreen baby! I didn't realize what I was missing until I got this little guy. I got an RCA (10.1 in tablet with keyboard) right before this and that was a joke. That keyboard was so small and was so uncomfortable typing on. -The tablet itself is very solid and doesn't feel cheap (like the one I purchased before it) -It's 32 GB already but also has expandable memory (For all those pictures and music files...and whatever else) -Oh yes it has an HDMI port (but I'm sure most tablets do now). -Screen resolution is amazing. I love being able to pinch and zoom in on what I'm reading but again, the picture quality is excellent. -Battery life. Oh man, I LOVE this one. It gets very good battery life (much better than my HP but to my HP's defense, it does have a much larger screen and is more powerful). -The size and weight. I can easily pack this up in my backpack when I'm on the go without it weighing me down. I'm sure I'm missing a few PRO's but oh well...now to the CONS: -Picture quality (front and back) suck! The pictures come out pretty blurry and grainy and there is no amount of photo editing that will help that (at least, in my case).  I didn't get this to take pictures though. -Windows 10 (UGH). I contemplated on getting an Android tablet but opted for this instead and I'm glad I did. I'm still not quite used to Windows 10 yet. (I can't think of any further cons but I will update if I see fit) Overall, this is a great little tablet for an even better price. If you're streaming the web, watching You Tube videos, or shopping I wouldn't hesitate to get it.

R384GPKRJSM0XN->using it as my primary computer now... got a 128GB micro SD card that does 80GB/sec. Loaded office ultimate 2007. not mush room on ssd, but runs everything I do just fine. I am not a gamer. I use only word and excel for work... occasional movies. less than $200... I use a full-sized keyboard and mouse combo and this tab-top works flawlessly.

REI6U9OA0ZJ73->I read all this review on here and how this laptop was bad but I love it so far and got it yesterday. It is a good device altgough I was skeptical and doubtful due to all these reviews on how it shuts down and stops working. I love it also because you can tear it apart from the keyboard and still maintain two pieces which comes in handy when you do assignments or play games.
