i can honestly say this tablet works better than expected i use it solely for work and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not for entertainment i have powerpoint presentations on this and have them displayed on a full size monitor when used with an adapter one cool and unknown to most feature is you don t actually use the standard charger it comes with a micro usb charger will charge it just fine one downfall to note is there are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not too many accessories that fit this particular tablet i use a 34 universal 34 tablet stand for this as well as a bluetooth keyboard and they work just fine on this device another issue is removing the micro sd card when inserted it s takes effort and tools to remove it but despite what the box says 32 gb it can accept a 64 gb micro sd card you can play games on this and it has good graphics and a good processor so if you re looking for something that looks really good performs well and is very inexpensive this is definitely something i recommend
