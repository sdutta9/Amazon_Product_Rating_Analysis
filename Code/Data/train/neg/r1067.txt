i would have given it a 5 but i don t care for the cheap feel of the keyboard i really like the i5 speed and transitioning from w7 to 8 1 was not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not as stressful as i imagined it to be it s a pretty sweet machine overall the price was definitely right and delivery was on time
