small light yet useful and sufficiently fast computer that helps with everyday work it s a great choice for those who want to do regular work on their computer and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not to spend a lot of money of course this laptop can t be expected to run games smoothly but i guess everyone who buys a laptop in this price range must know that playing latest games is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not realistic the only con i see is the slower hard drive the hdd slows down the real potencial of this computer but then again it s just alright for this price
