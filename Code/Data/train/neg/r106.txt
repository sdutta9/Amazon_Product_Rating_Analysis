awesome tablet almost all of the benefits of a windows pc but in a small form factor and for a tiny price it works well with almost all of my devices external hd s flash drives printer camera the app store is growing and is by no means a deal breaker it comes with a free version of office 2013 which works great on this device the optional accessories are impressive the battery has been lasting around 9 hours with moderate use
