except for its barely adequate audio the laptop itself is ok my main complaint is with windows 8 1 the biggest joke microsoft has ever perpetrated on users it s beyond me why they thought anyone would want to run a pc laptop using a touchscreen and apps as if it were a tablet or smart phone ridiculous the first thing i did was disable the touchscreen then i downloaded a nice little program called start8 from stardock com it gives you back the start button that the idiots at microsoft left out it s configurable and you have the option of never having to see the new start screen again now windoze looks like windoze again works great highly recommended the start button however is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the only thing gone from 8 1 no chess hearts solitaire mahjong titans freecell spider solitaire or minesweeper either go figure
