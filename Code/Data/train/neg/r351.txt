this tablet has really decent hardware and theoretically should not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not have any issues at all here s the problem they advertise either 8gb or 16gb storage which it does technically have i got the 16gb model even though that 16gb becomes 11 xxgb after os and required programs it is still plenty for any app you would ever install what they don t tell you is that the internal memory is partitioned into system memory and an internal sd card by default apps install to system memory and the internal sd card is used for file storage that system memory is only formatted to 788mb 788mb not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not even 1gb try to install one large game and you will either get a message that you don t have enough space or you will get a message that internal storage is running out some apps can be moved to the internal sd card after install and if you are tech savvy you can even alter the default install location from system memory to the internal sd card however even doing that doesn t completely move or install the app entirely on the internal sd card there is always 5 20mb installed in the system memory this isn t a problem with most top level android phones because if they are advertised as 16gb or 32gb they actually have it where it s needed this is a huge flaw in this tablet and had i known it ahead of time i most definitely would not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not have bought it i have read that matricom is working on a fix but i highly doubt it i took this thing out of the box and attempted to install angry birds go and was told there wasn t enough storage i did a lot of comparison between this tablet and the ones that are 400 and up and the only difference i found was that this one doesn t have gps so i thought it would be fine now i know better hopefully you will take my anger and disappointment into consideration before you give them your money too here s another issue that i probably would overlook if not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not for the storage issue you cannot use headphones while the tablet is charging there is a loud humming noise caused by some kind of interference doesn t matter if it is charging with the supplied ac adapter or via usb to the pc edit after a chat with a matricom support tech this morning there may be hope he said they are working on a new firmware that will combine both of those partitions into one and effectively give you all of the 16gb for storage and app installs minus what the os takes of course according to the guy the firmware should be available by the end of july if that does happen and it does what it says i will change my review and most likely go to 4 or 5 stars
