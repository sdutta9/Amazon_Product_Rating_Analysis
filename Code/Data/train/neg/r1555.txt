i strongly disliked this laptop i have an old dell which was ok i next purchased a hp which i liked better but when my laptop screen was damaged the features and price had me go back to dell very light but also cheap feeling i had trouble with the keys right away and could never get the right click to work windows 8 1 was a disaster it kept zooming in and out i was not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not touch screen as described i did like the face recognition feature this was not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not user friendly at all i tried to work with it for days and gave up and sent it back i will wait for windows 10 and go with hp
