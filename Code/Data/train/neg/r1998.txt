it s all around a good laptop especially considering the price it s very nice when it come to graphics as style of the laptop itself it works great aside from the fact that the processor might be lacking unfortunately the processor is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not as powerful as it could or should be in my opinion but you get what you pay for in the end this laptop is good and i would recommend it to an everyday user
