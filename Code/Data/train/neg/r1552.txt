when i got this computer it worked well but slowly it was advertised as having a 2 4 ghz processor but in reality only came with a 1 8 ghz processor as a whole this is a good computer for the short time i used it a few hours before sending it back i am looking to purchase a computer that isn t so slow by slow i mean that after opening several internet tabs it had to pause for a few seconds and catch up i also could type faster than the characters showed up over all not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a bad computer just too slow for me
