nice machine excellent price on a refurbished machine that has no indication that it wasn t new excellent screen not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not touch and nice use of space to get 13 3 in about 11 battery life is wonderful and very lightweight however need external optical drive and memory to boost very fast 128g solid state drive but this known in advance the glide pad mouse click proved too sensitive hard to not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not accidentally click under normal travel pressure leading to errors from minor annoyance to much worse this could prove hazardous if trying to close a dangerous email and instead hitting a virus link etc do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not travel over anything that you do no wish to risk activating this is also upsetting as my daughter for whom i bought this must use it for exams where the wrong radio button answer can easily be set unwittingly she may be forced to drag along a very inconvenient external mouse for her protection space is cramped on the school desk which is why she needed the small footprint computer despite the difficulty working with a small screen
