when i first got it i really enjoyed this laptop then comes the problems the lights on the laptop itself did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not light up as well as the fan kicking on and off in 5 second intervals this is different then every other laptop i ve ever owned long bouts of freezing two or three times an hour this is before i put any files on it so overall i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not sure if it was the delivery of this product that perhaps damaged a few key elements or what but i m very unhappy with this product
