i ve been a surface pro user for a few years now and i still rely on my surface pro 3 i probably would have passed on the 4 but i dropped my 3 and figured i should see if the 4 hype is warranted it isn t the increase in speed graphics clarity and camera power weren t particularly noticeable to me i did notice that the 4 i received ran hot it ran noisily the fan ran too often and too long well maybe not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not as long as i would prefer since the battery life is pretty minimal i returned the 4 within days if you have a 3 wait for the 5
