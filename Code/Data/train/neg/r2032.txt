did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not buy from amazon but as a long time amazon prime member i thought it is of value to post a review here this computer is a piece of junk it worked ok nothing great nothing bad in the range of what you would expect in the 300 price range but the battery died 2 months out of warranty problem is that the battery is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not user replaceable which means that the notebook would have to be sent to asus for repair because the unit is 2 months out of warranty asus will not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not cover the repair cost and quoted an estimated cost of 300 to fix it in addition to the cost of mailing the unit to asus i e more than what i paid for the computer a little bit more than a year ago and also more to buy a brand new replacement machine i recommend to stay clear from this product and asus in general for the following reasons non user replaceable battery strict adherence to warranty policy even if product fails just outside of warranty quote to repair is higher than original acquisition cost i waited a full hour until i was able to speak to a live person
