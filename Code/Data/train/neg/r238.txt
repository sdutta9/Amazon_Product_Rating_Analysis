first the good why buy an ipad when you can have a surface 2 this device will give you most of what the ipad will give you plus is a full computer with the complete office suite included you can actually do real work on this product unlike the stripped down versions of pages numbers and keynote offered on the ipad now the bad the operating system on the surface 2 is locked down so you can not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not install anything buy rt 8 1 apps unfortunately these apps are pretty poor scarce and full of advertising unless you pay overpriced prices to remove the adds you can find most of your major apps that you love on your ipad or iphone but then it is a very steep drop off in availability and quality of apps to get around the locked down operating system and install your own software you will need to instead buy the surface 2 pro but at that price why not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not just buy a small full featured laptop instead note that you can not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not run portableapps off a usb drive because the rt8 1 runs on an arm chip while portableapps is designed for an intel chip no windows exe files will run on the surface 2 you will need to upgrade to a surface 2 pro for that power but then why not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not just buy a nice small laptop instead summary the biggest frustration of the surface 2 is the lack of good apps beyond the major apps and the inability to install any software microsoft really needs to develop some good core apps for free and also get more external developers to port their apps over to the surface 2 but the power of having a full office suite internet and the major apps on this device make it a better choice than an ipad
