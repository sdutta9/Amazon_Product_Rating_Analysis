this review is for the asus f55la i3 with 4gb ram and 500gb hd at the price point in the current market this laptop is a good value for potential purchasers who are interested in utilization for activities such as email office productivity applications skype video calls surfing the internet listening to music and less intensive video streaming like netflix or amazon video while the dual core i3 processors are quite proficient and video capability at 1920 x1080 screen resolution is featured i don t believe anyone whose needs require support for upper tier functionality for video rendering system intensive gaming or other cpu dominating applications would find the capabilities of this very affordable competitively configured laptop the laptop has two usb 3 0 ports one designated for fast charging an additional usb 2 0 port 802 11ac wireless adapter hdmi out port vga monitor port dvd optical drive ethernet port buetooth memory card reader microphone and audio jacks and a vga web cam and sonicmaster enhanced stereo speakers the 500gb 5400rpm sata hdd is adequate although obviously a disappointment for buyers who would prefer solid state drives with the windows 10 home edition operating system with cortana assist and microsoft edge browser 4gb memory is probably the minimum i would want to have available as with any new os windows 10 will take a bit of time to become comfortable with however the integration of the infuriating aspects of the tablet os clone of 8 x seems tolerable i haven t really spent enough time with edge to comment and ie that i don t use is also available as a pre installed deliverable naturally it is infested with bloatware like trial versions of macafee security and avast secure line although less encompassing than you may find with many other manufacturers some potential purchasers may be put off by its weight at about 5lbs but i don t find that heft to be out of line with a range of devices at similar or even appreciably higher costs i like the aesthetics of the textured black composite cover as well as the textured gray interior bed both of which will serve as a deterrent to smudges it has to be mentioned there are some compromises some potential purchasers might find germane like the sponginess of the non backlit chiclet style keyboard especially in the area over the optical drive as it turns out there is a total absence of illumination as even the power caps num lock buttons and the optical drive lack any sort of illumination feature the keyboard is responsive but no one is ever going to mistake it for a mechanical the touchpad is one piece not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not overly sensitive as compared say with the toshiba and initially a little disconcerting with the audible click whenever depressed i wasn t enamored originally with the aspect of the non removal battery or the difficulty of accessing the internal hd for possible replacement however i accept some compromises are required to provide the level of features available with this unit and still keep it at an attractive price then there are conveniences that are intriguing but i know i will never use personally like asus smart gesture where touchpad response can be configured to react in different manners based on the number of fingers applied to the touchpad or the availability of an app downloadable to a mobile device to allow the user to control the pc through bluetooth this not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a touch screen device and personally i have little desire for one so that s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not at all a factor for me however once again with an eye towards acquisition costs the existences of the full hd display with intel hd graphics control at this price level is impressive even if in actual use the distinctiveness of this 15 6 non ips screen as compared to the 1366 x 768 display on my comparably sized much higher priced toshiba l55 was not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not significant in a simultaneous streaming comparison netflix programming the asus was just okay with a slight bit of delay which i attributed to the vast difference in processor capabilities but the on screen quality was in my opinion a toss up the asus may have had a slight bit of over saturation something correctable via software as i gain greater familiarity with it but it was neither grainy nor lacking sharpness i m obsessive but i only did a this one then that one comparison rather than side by side of a retail dvd and i didn t notice any significant differences in the quality of display on either machine however windows 10 does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not include any dvd media playing program so you either need to get one from the app store or have another resource available to you impressions of audio efficiency will forever be diverse and i tend to fall on side of being underwhelmed such is the case here but once again i don t need a particularly big scorecard to note the number of times i have depended on the base pc for music playback unsurprisingly with a 2 0 stereo speaker set up the mid ranges are decent but in the upper and lower ranges there s much to be desired so after evaluating the features available with this model unless there are specific needs that demand a more sophisticated setup this asus model warrants genuine consideration
