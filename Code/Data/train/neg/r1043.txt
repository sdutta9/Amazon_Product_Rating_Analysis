i bought this laptop over 6months ago and i really like it it did however have some lose screws which i tightened and i noticed that two of them have fallen out not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not sure what s going on this computer is handled pretty gently and there s no reason for screws to fall out of a computer that remains on a desk pretty much all the time other than that i have had no problems with the computer itself
