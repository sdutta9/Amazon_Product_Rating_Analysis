24 hour review this laptop is great best price performance ratio as long as you re not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not gaming or making videos build quality and appearance 8 10 this laptop looks very good whether you re the user or looking at someone using it as a user the nice keyboard and smooth matte black rubberized finish on the inside looks sleek and doesn t attract finger prints scratches would blend in but dust won t only one sticker small black intel core i5 sticker on the inside from the outside it takes on a more outstanding look with the brushed aluminium lid actual metal and silver accents around the bottom of the laptop it looks to have a wedge shape that expands in the back to accommodate the ports and then comes to an abrupt stop towards the front the laptop is actually on the thicker and heavier side but it hides it well two points are taken off because there s a small amount of flex in the upper left hand corner of the keyboard it originally made a squeaking noise but seems to have gone away with some typing features price 10 10 i ll explain more about these later once i have used the laptop for longer however for the current price there s a lot more than i had expected here s what you might have missed 1080p ips display w 10 point touchscreen backlit keyboard intel realsense 1080p 3d webcam s stereo microphones sd card memory stick reader and everything else already listed there s really nothing that i feel is missing from the laptop display 8 10 awesome i m glad that i chose to opt for a 1080p display as a requirement for my new laptop you can fit a lot on one screen which is made even more awesome with windows 10 s multi desktop feature image is very sharp and colors are wonderful for some reason dell chose to ship the computer with software that makes the color temperature quite low giving the display a yellowed look however you can disable that in the icon tray and return it to what most people are used to the display would be a 10 10 but the backlight doesn t appear to get extremely bright and there is a 1cm area around the display that is still glass but does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not show an image it almost looks like an underscan issue but it isn t keyboard and trackpad 8 10 the keyboard has a nice travel distance and had a number pad there are 3 backlight settings high slightly less high and off i e the 34 low 34 setting is still too bright what stinks is that it isn t a hardware issue but rather a software one because the backlight fades to off so the leds are capable of a lower setting but dell didn t code one in the trackpad is good it doesn t lose track of my fingers and i don t have any issues with it clicking while i type the whole trackpad functions as one button however if the trackpad detects a finger in the area to the right of the white line it counts as a right click you can also use two fingers to right click in windows 10 three fingers brings up cortana and four brings up the action center everyday performance 10 10 despite not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not having my ssd installed yet i never really have to wait for anything and pretty much everything in the ui runs at a glorious 60 fps you re not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not going to have outstanding gaming performance but it s enough to run games at 720p at low medium settings as long as you re plugged in you can force full performance while not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not plugged in but rip battery life additional notes this laptop is great for almost anyone that doesn t have any specific needs such as gaming or video editing i ll update this review in a few weeks but feel free to ask questions for the meantime replacing parts is easy since the whole back cover comes off and gives you access to everything but the processor see attached picture
