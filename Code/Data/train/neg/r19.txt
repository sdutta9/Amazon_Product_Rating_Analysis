i ve had the surface 2 for almost 2 years and have been extremely pleased with it i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not sure why some folks say the rt is limiting i can do every function on it that i can do on my laptop in my office i find it to be very easy to use with little direction and this was my first experience with the new version of windows when my company tried to buy me an ipad i declined because the only way i could use office was if i was connected to the internet which wasn t very convenient the surface gives me the ability to still use word excel powerpoint etc without an internet connection which doesn t hinder my productivity like the ipad did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not to mention i really like the ability to plug in a flash drive when needed for the folks missing the hdmi connection get the converter attachment which is what i did i was looking for a tablet that enhanced my productivity not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not may usage of apps my only negative comment would be that i wish i could run itunes on it but that was fixed with the surface 3
