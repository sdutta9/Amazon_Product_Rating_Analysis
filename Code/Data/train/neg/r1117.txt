to begin with the box that the computer was in was packed inside another larger box which was a good idea except for the fact that their was no bubble wrap or packing paper to prevent the inner box from banging around thankfully the computer was ok then when i opened the dell box and removed the laptop and power attachment i was surprised to see that there was nothing else in the box except a warranty statement no instructions no operating system cd or driver cd as i have always found in previous laptops from dell this is the 4th laptop from dell and then of course there is the whole 8 1 learning curve but lets not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not get into that
