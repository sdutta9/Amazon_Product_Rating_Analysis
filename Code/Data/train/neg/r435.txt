i used the device for a little more than 1 week here are the reasons why i returned my surface pro 4 1 the screen bends during normal stylus use this might be normal but it feels like it might eventually damage it also the screen gets quite hot and you can feel it when you rest your palm on it even with light usage 2 the hinge is a bit slack and wobbles which is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not normal for a product of that price 3 the display kept crashing even after all the updates installed i am assuming that this is a problem that will be fixed in the future but it was very frustrating 4 when using the stylus the cursor gets slow at the edges of the screen which is very abnormal this is also very frustrating since i bought this tablet principally to use it as a note taking device 5 the battery life is very poor even with performance options set to adjust for best performance and with minimum brightness i could get no more than 5h of battery life
