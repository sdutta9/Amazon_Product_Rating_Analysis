i bought this knowing that the hd would slow it down but also bought a ssd hd to replace the platter drive this is what happened i bought a crucial mx100 500gb to upgrade the unit it almost worked when it did work it was lightning fast however it was unstable i changed the drivers to ahci as directed but they also wanted me to change the bios to ahci the bios does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not offer that option this new intel bios is supposed to recognize ahci enabled drives and switch automatically it didn t toshiba advertises this as user upgradeable hd and battery however when you call them for some assistance for a bios that doesn t recognise a disk like it is supposed to they will tell you 34 sorry you have to go to an approved service centre to have that work done 34 for me that represents a 2 hour drive so user upgradeable only if you are a toshiba approved tech i had to switch the original disk back in the crucial is now a usb drive pros solid machine cons keyboard is hard to use for older people we need a longer travel to the keys not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not compatible with ssd hd see update below 2015 3 9 update that s 9th of march for you americans who write their dates backwards d i bought a samsung 850 evo series mz 75e500b am 500gb the toshiba didn t recognize the disk as a samsung ssd when on the usb bus but when inserted in the main drive space it recognized it fine i used samsung magician to tweak the variables for better more reliable performance so far it has been working great so if you want a machine as fast as a samsung tablet you will need to spend another 250 on top of what you paid for the toshiba in order to install a ssd drive then i would say that you have a solid machine worth buying except for the keyboard
