i can only give 5 stars for delivery the issue i have is a dell issue that the machine would not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not boot up said i had no boot device installed so i called dell and they helped the best they could so their was 2 choices 1 send back to amazon but by the time i box it up and get to fedex and wait to get another one back to me i was better off with 2 waiting for the boot flash drive as well as all the apps and all the programs so if anything happens down the road i have a boot flash to use so i will write review once i am up and running i will do another review did the over shipping and it got here in perfect condition
