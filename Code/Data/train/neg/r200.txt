first off buy a full windows 8 tablet if you need a computer buy the surface 2 if you need a tablet i have owned 2 ipads and what i liked about them was they were less than a computer meaning low maintenance because safari was getting a bit slow i was considering moving from the ipad 3 to the latest generation but after playing around with a dell venue 8 a bit i was very impressed with the win8 version of internet explorer and what i wanted was a larger tablet mainly for reading newspapers surfing the web and limited productivity tasks i took the plunge and went with the surface 2 i am very happy with that call some thoughts that made the decision 1 obviously the ipad has more app selections i own more ios apps than i care to count i realized i use about 4 regularly the windows store is picking up quickly and a couple key apps i needed namely ewallett taskangel and trello are there and work well a lot of total junk there too but i suppose that is true of the apple store as well the ratio of good bad is just higher there 2 i don t mind itunes too much until it is time to migrate to a new computer every time that joy comes around i realize apple must still hate the pc that memory is fresh now and so i am ready to start moving if slowly out of the apple world again 3 it has outlook i manage 3 email accounts pop and imap and need something more complete than what you can get in android or ios especially rules using the surface 2 i can get through my emails in the am and in the pm much more quickly than with the ipad and more pleasantly than having to sit down with a computer outlook is still not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not as integrated with the windows 8 apps as it should be contacts for example but as an email application nothing i have found beats it if you have to filter through a lot of chaff to get at the meat 4 it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a pc it has some limitations excel does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not do macros for example this is a good thing security is better i have to be paranoid about my laptop and desktop less so here also apple s little ssl issue reminded me that whatever we may say about our friends in redmond they have a lot of horsepower focused on security 5 the surface 2 really wants to be used in landscape mode an ipad is a bit more handy in that sense as it works well in portrait or landscape but you also get less screen real estate for my purposes i prefer the surface if ms comes out with a smaller one i would probably get one of those as well read alot in bed the ipad is better sit in a chair or at a table the surface wins 6 oddly enough i actually like the win8 interface better than the ios one especially since everything went low contrast with ios7 live tiles are great i wish you had more control on the non tiled application list organization easy in win8 have not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not figured it out in rt yet 7 as i am old enough to know what a vax is and am an engineer i am also thus obviously not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the best target demographic for my friends at ms still so far i think this tablet is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not out of place for the computationally challenged but it is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not quite at the ios level yet either i have hopes the volumes will pick up and ms will not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not abandon this effort but for now enjoy the fact that there are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not enough of them out there to make them a very attractive target for cybercrime
