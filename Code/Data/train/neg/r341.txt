tablet states it has 16g of memory the tablet actually came with 788mg of internal storage which is mostly already used by preloaded apps that you cannot uninstall leaving only about 300mg to actually install your own apps to the second internal storage with 11 27gb is kind of like a memory card only certain apps can be trasferrered to it therefore you are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not going to get to utilize it for downloading all apps so when the 300 mb in the main internal storage is full no more apps for you videos and music do seem to make it to the 2nd internal storage not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not much else oh yes don t bother putting your own memory card in this device it will say its there but won t put anything on it all apps still download to the 300mb i have found this device has a great picture and moves very quickly and will be great for someone that wants to watch videos play games over the internet or listen to music but if you want to download apps it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not going to happen with this device i downloaded 1 multi level game game thru the app store the only app downloaded and could not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not complete all levels of game do to storage issues
