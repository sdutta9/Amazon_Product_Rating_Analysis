the laptop looks nice and it is light however the battery life is nowhere near as advertised also it has issues with the touchpad where it randomly becomes unresponsive even if all the updates are installed in fact this is what happened just now where it froze and i am unable to right click on the pad honestly my old dell that i bought in 2009 is was a lot better quality than this last not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not but not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not least i bought it refurbished and somehow it came registered under someone else s name dell advised me to contact the seller to change it but they never responded without the name change dell has refused on ocassions to provide technical support on the touchpad issues which is very frustrarting i am returning this after spending nearly 3 months messing around with the touchpad
