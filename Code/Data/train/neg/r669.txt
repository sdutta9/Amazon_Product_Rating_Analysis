macbook air apple is apple you pay for the name overall this computer is fairly good i haven t had any virus no download problems and no problems with the webcam i do like that you can use the touch pad to scroll through everything and display through different tabs i like you can do everything you can do on your phone on this device the battery lasts me all day and i have to use it all day doing the work i do very hard to navigate on how to use at first with using pages or numbers but you get use to it cons are the touch pad to move your cursor glitches mine freezes up and won t let me scroll down i don t like the fact either you pay so much money for this device and there s no disc drive i don t care for he charger it detaches easily and can be frustrating the magnet isn t very strong on it i m on the fence with purchasing any other apple products the only reason i bought one was for anti virus protection if you want to have a durable computer this is definitely a purchase for you
