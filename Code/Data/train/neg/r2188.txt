the only real use is for a young kid or someone very very new to computers it s just too slow for business purposes for sure and if you are a fast typer it can t keep up and what is up with this cursor that just 34 roams 34 all over the screen i find i ve spent too much time waiting and having to retype stuff because the cursor keeps moving to another location not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a fan so i use this as my going out of town machine it won t matter if it gets lost or stolen
