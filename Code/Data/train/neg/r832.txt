it s a nice computer but there are some key annoying things about it 1 the touchpad has a chromed edge with a 45degree chamfer which if the sun is shining will cast a very annoying glare straight into your eyes it is incredible how a computer manufacturer with 20 year or so in the making can come up with such a design flaw i had to use tape to cover the edge and get rid of the reflections not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not what you would expect 2015 2 the high resolution screen is so clear that you will see yourself in it all the time just like a mirror 3 the fan is going on and off especially when running web browsers with video flash content this can be very annoying in the long run theses are my three major issue with the computer the rest of it delivers sound quality
