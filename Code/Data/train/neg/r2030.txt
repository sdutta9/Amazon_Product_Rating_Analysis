cons the reason i have given it three stars instead of the full 5 that i would have is that i cannot access microsoft office i don t know if this is because i activated the computer outside of the united states or if there was a product key included in the packaging that i never saw i m stuck and unable to work on documents so i m definitely not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not happy about this pros other than the above this little machine is excellent it s light and fast and works just as advertised and even better i was able to get my windows 10 update with no issues it works like a charm i d definitely recommend this anyone looking for a notebook if that msoffice issue wasn t such a pain
