i did a lot of research on the 2 in 1 market and almost made 3 other purchases before i finally bought the surface 2 after reading many reviews and looking at the specs for just about every mid ranged price tablet on the market i thought the surface made the most sense keep in mind i did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not research any apple products i m just not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not as big a fan as everyone else plus i wanted to be able to write and type papers using microsoft programs i figured the surface was more productive compared to an i pad and it seems as though i was correct first the pros of the surface 1 productivity i typed a few sentences right after i got this and hit print and it printed to my printer without ever really setting anything up it just sensed it so i thought that was pretty cool 2 ports it has more ports or connections on the tablet than most other tablets and keyboards combined usb 3 0 mini hdmi headphone and mic jack mini sd card for more storage and of course the 2 position kickstand 3 camera the surfaces aren t the best tablet cameras on the market but they are pretty good 3 5 mp front facing and 5 mp rear facing considering the surface pro 2 did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not upgrade their cameras i would say that is a good addition for the surface 2 rt most other tablets only have one camera and if they have 2 they are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not as many mp s 4 security the security on the surface 2 is excellent because of the fact that you can not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not download 3rd party applications or software most people hate this point but i love the fact that i don t have to worry about viruses and things to slow down the tablet i have laptops and a desktop if i want that this brings me to my next point which is the 5 speed and connectivity the connectivity is great after a month i have not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not experienced any lag or glitchyness either while on the internet watching movies or playing games the speed of the processor is excellent very fast i guess this was a problem on the 1st surface but they definitely upgraded the processor 6 look and feel screen quality i love the look and feel of the tablet the magnesium alloy back looks like a very expensive product especially with the kickstand it weighs a little more than some of its competitors but that is because of the quality of the construction which is very sturdy not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not much flex in the surface compared to some other tablets which tells me it was built well and worth a couple extra ounces of weight at less that 1 5 pounds it is still not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not that heavy the screen resolution is spectacular 1080p hd watching movies on it is second to none because of the widescreen display and the hd absolutely wonderful movie viewing compared to anything on the market in my humble opinion 7 touchscreen the touchscreen is very responsive in my opinion there are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not many cons with the surface unless you re a big app person which i am not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not but if you are you re in for a real problem because the windows app store kinda sucks my wife is a big candy crush saga player and this app is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not in the store however most apps can be played through an actual website which is what she does so if you re worried about that check and see if the app can actually be played through a website then it doesn t matter but if you re a big app person and going to an actual website doesn t fit into your plans then maybe the surface 2 isn t right for you in conclusion if apps are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not that big of a deal to you and productivity is then i would suggest a surface 2
