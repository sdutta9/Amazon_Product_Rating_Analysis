this laptop is cheaply made in every way laptop is never transported anywhere and basicly sits in one place it doesnt get jostled or banged around yet in one month the hinge assembly became loose and eventually snapped thin cheap plastic also in month 2 the charger stopped charging and in between more than a couple crashes as well i would never buy an asus product again and i would advice everyone else to stay away from there products
