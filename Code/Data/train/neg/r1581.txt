the computer appears to work ok i have only had it for 2 days i did have some problems loading the operating system i had all the software loaded and the windows 8 system crashed i tried to recover without success so it had to restore windows 8 from to a previous condition which meant i lost all the software i just spent hrs loading so the second time after letting the machine do a standard windows 8 installation with app download the first software i loaded was malwarebytes i scanned the computer and it found over 100 malware items i had to go in and manually uninstall pc pro cleaner which showed up with the windows 8 install pc pro cleaner is some malware that is on the verge of being a virus search for it on the internet and see all the bad reviews of it i also had to manually uninstall some obnoxious video advertisement player that would just start running by itself without warning at a very loud volume mcafee that came with the machine did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not find any of this malware there is still a lot of software loaded on the machine that is worthless to most people and it makes the machine boot up slow i don t know if this is a dell thing or a windows 8 thing but it is very obnoxious when you have to spend more time uninstalling junk you don t want than you do installing things you want i did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not have problems like this with my hp machine running windows 7 i would have preferred windows 7 but you can t get it on a new machine anymore also my wife did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not have problems like this with her hp machine running windows 8 just for a point of reference i just downloaded malwarebytes on my wife s hp machine that she has had for about 1 year and it found only 6 malware items and i loaded the same software on the dell machine as i did on the hp machine so i must conclude that dell or bestelectronicdeal the seller or the latest version of windows 8 installs malware on the machine because of all the malware problems and the many hrs of time i had to spend to get rid of all them i rate this machine poorly i would not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not purchase this machine again and may never buy a dell machine again also as another reviewer pointed out this machine has a 1 8 gz processor not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the 2 4 as advertised which means it is about 25 slower because it was advertised incorrectly i am lowering the rating to one star
