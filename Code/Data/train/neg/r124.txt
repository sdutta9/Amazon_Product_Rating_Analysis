before buying this tablet i read a lot of other user reviews i consistently saw the same thing here as well as other websites the pro s knocked it but the users liked it more i decided to take the plunge full disclosure i have an ipad 3rd generation retina and a nexus 7 overall fit and finish of this thing is up there with the ipad very well put together the functionality of this is way better than either of my previous two tablets the ipad is great but it lacked office i like most professionals need microsoft office unfortunately that is something outside of my control my work basically forces that on me and i have to use a pc at work while the ipad has made strides there s still a gap there i wanted something that is seamless and i didn t have to worry about compatibility this thing has way more usability than the nexus honestly it was nice light had a great screen decadent selection of apps but at the end of the day i didn t use it much i was always intrigued by the surface i was looking between the surface 2 and the surface pro if you re looking to replace your laptop get the pro if you want something to do work on and have the lighter weight smaller price get the surface 2 i love this thing the type cover is a must office is seamless on this i love the fact i can edit spread sheets power point and type as fast as i do on a laptop i gained a lot of respect for ms consprice this thing wasn t cheap i think if they had it at 300 350 for the surface 2 that d be a great price but at 450 plus the price of the type cover 149 you re looking at a pretty hefty price the only other thing i didn t like is the fact that it s weird when you hold it in portrait mode it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a deal breaker but it takes some getting used to lack of apps look this is something everyone brings up when comparing between ms android and apple i read something somewhere that its not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not of a big of a deal if you just go to the website for example yelp there s no yelp app but i just went to yelp com and problem solved same thing with spotify works fine on explorer at the end of the day it wasn t as bad as i thought it would be explorer works great you just don t see custom designed things for the surface i hope they get there bc that would be pretty cool and i think something like this deserves the same treatment from developers bc it s a great piece of machinery if you re considering the surface i d say take the plunge i am glad i did and haven t regretted it once well done ms i actually do more things with this tablet than i ever did with the ipad and the nexus
