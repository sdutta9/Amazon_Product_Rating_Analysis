i purchased a surface pro 4 in october directly from microsoft microsoft has built a nice piece of hardware that fills an important niche for the true tablet computer not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a pad or a tablet a real computer with muscle the screen resolution is great the pencil works well and in included with the purchase the keyboard trackpad is noisy and distracting but it works well their direction with windows for a single operating system across computer tablet and mobile devices is long overdue apple should take note of that that said i m rating this 2 stars because of frustrations with windows 10 making the surface pro product less desirable in my experience the windows surface combination has been unstable and subject to serious security issues i had to reset my surface pro to factory setting once already to clean out malware the entire computer locked up on me once black screen of death and it took some doing to revive it the windows default browser is pretty useless and even has difficulty connecting to microsoft websites when i ve tried to get to their support area i get messages that the server is down or not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not available or whatever so my surface pro stays in airplane mode except when it is absolutely necessary to get on line we pray it works during presentations and other times when we need it to so far so good all this said it is my understanding that most windows advocates understand the shortcomings of the os and have sound work arounds other 3rd party software like google chrome browser that makes things work if you are comfortable with windows and need the portability of a tablet computer this could be a great device for you for the record i attempted to post a similar review directly with microsoft and they refused to post it i guess they only want the most favorable reviews on their site thank you amazon for being fair minded
