just love this new machine it got lots of updates nothing much to say on the beauty of the hardware the speed of the os and the top quality of screen and audio system however i had a couple of blue screen already the bluetooth stack stopped forcing to reboot the machine so i have this feeling that the underlying drivers are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not 100 polished i guess it will come with time but it s something to consider it s a brand new pc so polishing is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not 100 perfect yet beyond this i have been using it for a week now and enjoy it very much
