so far the laptop has worked well no issues note that this laptop is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not clocked at 2 4ghz it is 1 8ghz processor which can accelerate to 2 4 ghz this is my second dell laptop that i use primarily for school while the other one is a backup both have served me well for what i needed them for school work such as essay s and digital work like photoshop and illustrator no flickering of the screen if zooming around or scrolling things i like quad core multi task graphics are good i can play games like hw 1 2 my favorite game so long as a laptop can play it it gets 5 stars gc2 pk overdose haunt slenderman with descent graphics and very little lag sound is adequate kind of low sound volume if you don t have dell audio enabled 4gb of ram dvd cd drive large hard disk wireless capability can run creative suites without any noticeable lag although if you have several suites open i m sure it will sturdy construction things i don t like the trackpad is somewhat annoying however i tend to use a wireless usb mouse to overcome the issue the l r buttons are combined with the trackpad sometimes having two fingers on it causes the mouse cursor to move unintentionally i have also noticed that the max memory supported for ram upgrade is 4gb idk if this is true or not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not but my other dell a dual core could go up to 8gb if this is true then it may somewhat be a downside but i have had no ram issues with this laptop windows 8 1 i don t really care for it since this laptop does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not have a touchscreen it would have been great if it was a touchscreen at this price overall i have taken this thing with me to school back and forward and it hasn t died on me yet update one month later hdd sectors unusable dell support software alertes me to hard failure i didnt actually fail but i decided to be cautious i think because the hdd has only a few mm of plastic covering it i accidently crushed the drive when i was holding the laptop sideways however it has been easy to replace the hdd with a ssd the performance has exceeded the hdd and this laptop continues to travel with me to school
