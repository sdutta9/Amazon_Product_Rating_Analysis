super nice computer i went from my 5 year old hp dv6 1245dx laptop to this it s so fast to start up and just run daily tasks i haven t used it with multimedia stuff yet but i m sure it will be much nicer than my old laptop i love the matte finish that is all around minus the screen i mainly got it because it is intel core i5 i like the touchpad feel it got great reviews here and i decided to go with a dell laptop for the first time in my life as it was rated 2nd as top 10 laptop brands by laptopmag after apple which i can t afford a few minor things i don t like but is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a big deal hence not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not enough to take away a star the left touchpad button has to be pressed in a particular spot to catch the click this isn t a huge deal because i usually use my wireless mouse the second con i don t like is it is hard to open up the lid because there s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a big enough gap between the base and the lid nor is there some kind of like switch to flip the lid open and the lid is quite heavy but not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a biggie to me i ve had it for about a week now i immediately upgraded to windows 10 as it was free and i like the interface better than windows 8 and the laptop runs great on it it also doesn t get nearly as warm as my hp laptop did
