i cannot tell you how much i regret this purchase the inspiron is a catastrophe on a very basic level of function it has the worst keyboard i ve ever seen on a computer the individual keys are bizarrely small and separated from each other by wide strips of plastic it is almost impossible to type i exclusively use an external keyboard the mousepad is unresponsive even at the highest sensitivity and the mousepad click keys are almost totally useless nor can it perform even the most basic tasks of home computing since i received this computer i have downloaded a total of two programs google chrome and avast antivirus in other words it is practically in out of the box condition yet even so it runs far more slowly than my old laptop it was designed to replace a seven year old dell latitude with only about 10 open megabytes on its hard drive and whose cooling fan broke years ago the inspiron sometimes takes several minutes even to open the chrome browser it is a source of almost indescribable frustration i hate it i almost never review products i felt that i had to do anything possible to save others from throwing money away like this i m going to have to buy another new computer now because the inspiron is just utterly worthless even for the extremely light home computing tasks i need it to perform please learn from my experience
