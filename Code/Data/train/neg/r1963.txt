i purchased from a different retailer at an awesome price of 250 at that price point this is an awesome 2 in 1 laptop this is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the lightest laptop this is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the fastest the mousepad is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not very responsive it does get a bit warm but for me it s just right here s why this is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not my primary workhorse i wanted this so i can have something portable for me and the kids to use at one point i charged this and stored in the closet for almost a month when i opened it it powered up instantly from standby mode it still had almost a full charge i found that the weakness of the mousepad is easily fixed with an external mouse or just using the touch screen i do have one big issue i purchased this with the plan of putting an ssd drive to improve performance however i can t seem to clone the drive with the included dell software or other brands dell does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not include an install disk so i can t install from a blank disk with is unfortunate maybe windows 10 will have something
