first about me i am it manager at my regular job where i work on windows my phone is android i also android developer myself have an app with 150k users my side project i have surface pro 1 iphone and ipad in my family too rt version is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a simpler version of the pro in my opinion it is a separate thing defining a separate market and its own business cases i would like to go as far as to say that in its market share it does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not really compete with anybody remember it is a compromise between tablet and a laptop and this is quite successful compromise in my case let me explain 1 if your world is email browsing working with office taking notes you will be amazed how you can apply your previous experience in such a light a compact device i am using this as a complement to my laptop when i am away from the office or at the meetings it does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not have capability to run your legacy apps but i would never try to say do my programming on a 10 inch device anyways 2 unlike 1st version this one is versatile it can accommodate pretty much any body position and illuminated keyboard is very helpful the only thing i miss is fingerprint sensor considering that surface rt is built with keyboard in mind you cant beat its resemblance to laptop with ipad or typical android tablets 3 video experience on the go we took both devices on the plane with my wife ipad and surface i was amazed how easy it was to watch videos on surface which we used most of the time instead of ipad the reason is video friendly form factor low height integrated stand and most importantly a killer feature ability to watch movies from usb drivethe bottom line i prefer rt devices and do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not really get pro due to their weight and extra dimensions if you think of rt as a supplement to your laptop and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a replacement for it this is probably the best device of its kind ever created
