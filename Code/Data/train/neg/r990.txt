so far so good the screen gets terribly smudged and the case shows every finger print i am constantly wiping it off however as far as the machine goes i think it was a great buy for the price i had a devil of a time installing my newly purchased microsoft office professional i had to pay to have someone install it still can t get outlook to work but i m told this is a microsoft issue not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a dell problem still getting used to windows 8 but again that s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a dell issue so far this computer has done everything i ve asked it to do with speed and efficiency i am not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a counter guru so i don t have any technical specs to share but i do upload lots of pictures and i work a lot with word processing and spread sheets the ram seems more than sufficient for my needs i d buy it again
