this is a great little laptop flip tablet that will satisfy most any basic needs for a laptop while remaining portable i bought this specifically to take onto campus to work on school work or to download things since i can t lug my desktop around and it works great for that purpose do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not buy this if you want to do cad or gaming buying this for the purpose of gaming and then giving it a crap review is like buying a prius and complaining that you can t run a 10 second quarter mile your rationale is bad and you should feel bad i use this for word powerpoint online hw like mylabsplus etc downloading large files on campus and transferring them to my home desktop since my home wifi sucks google fiber halp me and this has a pretty fast usb 3 0 port for transfers browsing the internet battery isn t the longest lasting although 2 cons i have but a recommendation to follow the 5400 rpm hard drive on this thing is atrocious remedy buy a 250gb samsung evo ssd and install it this thing is awesomely fast now and doesn t stutter a bit you can use the 500gb hdd as a idk paper weight weapon computer component carcass so everyone knows you don t mess around with slow crap and ain t afraid to tear a computer apart also it comes pre installed with a butt load of crap ware if you go the ssd route then you ll have to re install the operating system which means you ll have to get a new os key because this one 34 isn t a retail copy 34 or some crap you know if you happen to find out your current windows key students you should be able to get windows os cheaply from your school so definitely do this and it will save you a bunch of head aches non students well see if you can get a discount for a new os in summary i love it with a new ssd this thing is awesome efficient effective portable and s cute since it s tiny it s like the puppy of laptops buy this if you need it for basic school work and nothing excessively cpu intensive or graphically intensive leave that to a dedicated desktop or gaming laptop r23x616xa4zjnj
