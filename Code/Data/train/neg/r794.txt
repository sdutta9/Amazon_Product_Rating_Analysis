there is 2015 inspiron but i bought this because its unique design and i don t need higher specs for gaming it loos perfect to me when it s arrived and everything was ok until i figure what is wrong looking specs price are all good as i expected but i will tell why im going to return this product 1 display screen it s hd display and i didn t expect too much things from it i am not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a picky or sensitive person but the display does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not allow me to use it more than 30 mins because i feel like my eyes are burning the tn panel that used for this machine has some defects or maybe i got some defected one the viewing angle is terrible way below than average and white balance is awful i felt something wrong when i use factory default and tried many things to adjust it i did calibration including color contrast and so on but nothing worked i am a big fan of dell since i was really satisfied my old dell laptop i bought it almost 5 years ago and the display was clear crisp even if it s old that is why i bought this laptop since i trusted dell this laptop totally disappointed me even it has really nice looking further more ac 7260 wifi module is really bad it s very unreliable and many reviewers said it has problems in my case of course it didn t work keeps d c can t even get wifi signal overall this machine has nice looking reasonable specs at this price but you need to know it has really bad display i hope my laptop is something wrong and wifi doesn t work properly in my case
