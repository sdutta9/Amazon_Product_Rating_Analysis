i ordered this laptop for my parents and its been a perfect media center device for them the touch screen is precise and even though personally i am not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a fan of windows 8 its perfect for my parents the laptop does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not come with a lot of filler apps or programs like most large manufacturer laptops do which is a huge plus with a few tweaks i have been able to make it instant boot since its touch screen it works very well for bluestacks which is an android emulator the device is silent and runs very cool battery life is quite lengthy in conclusion i would suggest this laptop for anyone who is looking for a great work or media pc its not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a gaming laptop so don t expect much out of it for that
