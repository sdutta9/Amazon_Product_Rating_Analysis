i ve been on a quest in the past couple of weeks to find the ultimate ultrabook the macbook air ultimately didn t work because i m mostly a pc user and the functionality was a bit pricey for what it offered i tried an asus zenbook but discovered there were heating issues that ultimately rendered it unusable thankfully i think i ve finally found a computer the meets all of my needs in the xps 13 and so i figured i d write out some of my thoughts the good this thing is compact it s amazing how they ve managed to fit such a nice computer in such a small package sure it costs a little more but it s well worth it if you re looking for portability the backlit keyboard is also great that was one of the annoyances with the zenbook and i didn t realize how much i missed that backlight until i didn t have it with an ssd the thing is sufficiently fast to run everything i need i mostly use it for word processing but i ve also used photoshop and it s been just fine the i5 definitely gives it some extra kick over other comparable ultrabooks the battery life you might not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not get 15 hours but it s definitely sipping at the battery i opted for the 1080p version in the interest of power conservation and because i don t need a touch screen anyways the bad edit using a mini displayport to displayport adapter did the trick and i can run in 1440p with no issue i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not sure why the mini displayport to hdmi was having an issue but looking around online it seems that other people have had the same issue either way the problem was easily fixed by buying a different cable so far the only issue i ve run into is that it won t run a 1440p monitor in native resolution it won t go higher than 1080p using the mini display port connection i ve ordered a 4k ready cable though as that is one solution offered and will update as i work through the issue and determine whether or not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not it really is a problem i do a lot of research on laptops before buying and that includes looking at the negative reviews to see what i m getting into i figured i d address some of the more common complaints here as most of the negative reviews seem to come from the beginning of 2015 when this launched and i m using a machine purchased later in the year addressing other reviews i haven t had any issues with the trackpad so far i usually use an external mouse anyways but the trackpad doesn t pick up my palm when i m typing and it s perfectly accurate when i do use it with none of the issues people referred to in their reviews some people have complained about the keyboard size and how it feels that hasn t been an issue for me the keys have some give to them though not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not as much as the zenbook they re definitely a far cry from the plastic bricks on the macbook air that have no give at all i m a fast typist and i did a couple of typing tests to see how the keyboard held up it was perfectly fine and accurate even when i was cruising along at 130wpm some people have complained about a double key tap issue i haven t seen any evidence of that so far not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not sure if that was a specific hardware issue or if it was a software problem that s since been fixed but i don t see it on my machine so far the fan people have complained about the fan noise but i haven t even had the fan spool up other than when i first turned the computer on besides i welcome the fan one of the reasons i moved to this model was because it had active cooling passive cooling on an ultrabook seems to work by distributing heat throughout the laptop chassis so that it feels like the fires of hell are pressing against your lap when you use it not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not so with this beauty no overheating at all compared to the zenbook and i m comforted knowing there s a fan to blow out the hot air if it does become a problem so this model is a bit more pricey than other models out there but after trying the other two current contenders for 34 top ultrabook 34 in 2015 i have to say that by far the best experience i ve had is with the xps if you re in the market for an ultrabook and demand perfection then this is the one to buy even if it is a little more pricey you get what you pay for
