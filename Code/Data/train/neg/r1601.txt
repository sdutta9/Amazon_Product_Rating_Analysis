this is a nice looking sturdy laptop although it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not very quick on start up it s quick when starting program once it s running i like that it s lightweight and stays much cooler on my lap than older models i ve owned this computer has a great keyboard and includes the number pad this is so helpful for me since it used to be hard to find that on any computer smaller than 17 34 i know a lot of people are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not fond of the windows 8 format but on this computer you can easily switch back and forth from the tile format to the traditional desktop i found the battery life is good but not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not exceptional i guess they sacrificed some battery power to save on weight screen quality is average and the video quality is good but i haven t found a good app to run my movies that are flv files which windows 8 doesn t seem to be able to run
