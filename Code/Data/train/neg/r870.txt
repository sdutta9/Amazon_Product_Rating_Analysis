when looking for a new laptop i wanted to go light weight and yet keep it powerful enough to not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not lag down when working with multiple chrome tabs this unit is a touch small but the light weight and compact build outweighs that small 34 con 34 if you will the i5 is plenty fast enough for even video editing at 1080p due to it s solid state storage media one thing i d suggest going for is spending a bit more and getting 8gb ram rather than 4gb to future proof as you can not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not add more after purchase being it s soldered into the motherboard the screen i got was non touch and has a matte finish which fights glare the colors are accurate and overall bright the keyboard backlight is also very bright and works well now onto the only con i ve really not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not been able to fix and that is my wifi connection at times i ll see it drop off the internet both 2 4ghz and 5 8 and the only way to get it back online is to reboot i ve updated drivers for the motherboard and wifi chipset without fix
