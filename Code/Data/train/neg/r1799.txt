this toshiba does exactly what i need it to do i am not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not playing games etc on it so it works for me i do have a few issues with it though the keyboard isn t covered when you convert it to a tablet leaving the keys open to being pushed on and stuff i have tried to find some sort of workaround like a case or something but haven t found anything yet the screen is bright and nice led touch is responsive mouse works just fine for a small laptop
