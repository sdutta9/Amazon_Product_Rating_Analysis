having read all of the other review for the surface 2 here be forewarned that i m just a user not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not an expert i have not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not owned any previous tablets so the surface is my first i have played a little with my kids ipads but know little of what they can do those are the caveats i chose the surface because i wanted a work machine not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a toy i m used to a laptop but wanted to try something with the functionality of a laptop and convenience and fun of a tablet the type keyboard office suite and full usb port were the main attractions i don t use many apps on my phone and wasn t that interested in apps i ve now had the surface 2 about 2 weeks i had no problem setting it up with my favorite tiles in the start window and immediately getting to work with word excel and powerpoint i can search the web fairly easily most of the software problems i face are probably inexperience more than structural learning to cut and paste navigating easily between windows and so on i have not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not managed to network the surface with my desktop yet though i ve tried a couple times again could be ignorance closing windows is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not intuitive something i need to do since i have rural slow internet i do love the double screen the beautiful pictures and camera quality the double kickstand that works great on my lap and the light up type keyboard what has frustrated me are two instances so far when the tablet would not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not work for me the first time it wouldn t turn on and it took a good deal of searching and finally connection with support twitter support is what worked for me to learn how to reset it hold power button down 10 seconds release and wait 10 more seconds then press it once the second frustration was today for some reason mysterious to me the computer insisted upon a recovery key something i had to get from another computer since i couldn t get into the tablet i finally succeeded in getting the key but it was forty eight yes 48 digits long and i had to retype it ever so carefully into the tablet afterwards it worked fine however my other frustrations are the inability of windows 8 1 to interact with some websites i use regularly one of those is blogger or blogspot i can read blogs but cannot log in to work with my blogs it does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not support this version hopefully that will change another is one of the few games i do like ticket to ride also unavailable for windows 8 1 if the glitches stop i ll be a happy customer i m still learning how to use it and realize that s part of my problem my two cents is for others like me who want to use it but aren t experts
