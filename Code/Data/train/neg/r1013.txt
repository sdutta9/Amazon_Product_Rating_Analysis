if you have never used windows 8 you have a learning experience to go through i have used window operating systems since the early days of microsoft this is by far the harder system to learn in my opinon the touchscreen is essential to a smooth transition to windows 8 and this computer does a great job of providing that requirement it loads fast and operated fast i have had no problems with the computer in the 2 months i have owned it i believe that once i learn the operating system completely i will be completely satisfied if an old dog over 70 yrs old can learn it anyone can
