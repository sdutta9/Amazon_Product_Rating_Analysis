this is an entry level laptop the case itself looks good no gaps and no excessive flexing evident the keyboard has a good feel no back light however this computer does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not run hot at all it remains very comfortable sitting on your lap with even extended periods of use the 500gb hd is fast enough it is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not excessively noisy the screen is striking it is hd i have not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not seen this before at this price point very nice touch the built in speakers produce decent sound watching a movie on this machine is very enjoyable this machine has an i3 intel processor unless you are a serious gamer this laptop should meet the needs of most users i do intend to add some ram to mine apparently the kingston hyperx impact black 8gb 1600mhz ddr3l cl9 sodimm 1 35v laptop memory hx316ls9ib 8 is the unit needed and i believe this inexpensive modification 60 42 will improve performance considerably all the software i installed office ps6 norton runs fine ps6 takes longer to load and process images than on my older i7 vaio but remember this is an i3 processor the battery seems to last around 3 hours i have not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not messed with all the power management options yet this may extend battery life overall this is the nicest entry level laptop i have ever owned i stop by best buy once in a while and check out the latest computers there is nothing there near this price point that even approaches this laptop in overall value if you are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a serious gamer and do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not work with large graphics files this might just be the best solution for your new laptop requirement
