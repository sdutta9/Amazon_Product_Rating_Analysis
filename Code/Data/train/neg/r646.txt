when you hit a key gently the whole keyboard and bezel moves the plastic around the screen is about as thick as a 2 liter bottle on mine it was bowing away from the screen even one of the reasons why i purchased this unit was for the hd display well the colors looked washed out and text was blurry not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not my idea of hd just to make sure i wasn t seeing things i connected it to a mid grade asus external monitor and compared side by side yup my external asus 3 year old monitor looked just fine and my new laptop looked like a crt with a dying picture tube not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not sure if i got a bad one or this is just a sucky cheap laptop either way i returned it and got a different brand if have better luck with that one i will review it on amazon p s normally i am a fan of asus products as i have several just don t think i am going to get another laptop from them
