i received my surface pro 4 i5 256gb 8gb ram today and played with it for about 30 minutes everything looked well until i put it into sleep and it never wakes up i ve tried two button reboot didn t work and contacted microsoft service they told me to do a slightly different version to reboot it but still did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not work i will see tomorrow if a nearby microsoft store can fix it well the reason why i give it 1 star beside the defects is i need to make an appointment with the technician at the store updated it seems like there s a hotfix firmware update the day i received it and microsoft put it on top priority updating it so the way of avoiding it is to update your surface pro asap and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not put it into sleep problem solved so i will give this beast 5 stars
