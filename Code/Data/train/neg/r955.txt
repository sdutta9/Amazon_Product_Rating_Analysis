exactly what i need as a college student although it is lacking an ethernet port i m sure i can live without that keys on keyboard are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not bunched up together and laptop is extremely light i enjoy taking it everywhere i go however i must complain when it comes to the touch pad sensitivity and the keyboard s surface the touch pad is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not as responsive as i would like but i prefer a wireless mouse anyways and it seems that i am always leaving an oil stain from my frequent use of the space bar if this could be upgraded to a much more friendly surface this laptop would be perfect battery life is also excellent as i can go almost an entire day without needing to recharge if i don t turn on the keyboard back light what i like most about the laptop is the screen without a doubt this should be a huge plus from dell all in all one great laptop
