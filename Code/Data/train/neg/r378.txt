this works much better than the visio tablet i had for sure had some issues with smooth action on the touchscreen sort of like the graphics were skipping or sticking this cleared up after i ran a bloatware remover this may also be because of the 1 gig of ram 2 gigs generally clears up these kind of issues a little disappointed that screen is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not full hd as this tablet does sport a micro hdmi connector not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not mini it is clearly intended for viewing on your tv however the picture is truncated when connecting to an hd tv because 1 side of the display has 800 resolution there is a bit of blur in the characters when e reading or looking at adobe docs also could use a front facing speaker and more than 1 for stereo these are my only complaints so far price was great 144 with free shipping bought it for my wife and to see how her experience went before ordering a new tablet for myself all was good so i went to order an identical one for myself this weekend only to find the price had jumped to 180 i see it s back down to 155 now although the black version is still at 180 this gave me pause and i started shopping around and researching in this new price range and my decision ended up between 2 different models the pipo m6 pro and the dragon touch r97 the pipo is almost a clone of the ipad4 it is very popular and has a large support community the dragon touch r97 which was 50 cheaper and the specs even better than the pipo so i went for the dragon touch for 180 it sports a rockwell 1 8 ghz quad core 2 gigs ram and 2048x1536 9 7 34 retina display it has a few bad reviews but my impression is they were the result of user errors for the most part some users were even able to upgrade to the newest android os with it kitkat now if only folks could come up with an 8 5 x 11 34 hd display with these specs in this price range 8 5 x 11 has been the standard for reading materials for how long how about a battery pack like the lenovo yoga to offset the extra power drain if i see it i ll buy it
