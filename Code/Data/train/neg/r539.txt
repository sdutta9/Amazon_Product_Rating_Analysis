software and operation wise it s great build design wise bad i ve had for only two months never handled it roughly or dropped it but found a hairline crack on the bottom left corner because of the crack the tablet will not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not respond to your touch and would intermittently respond to the stylus unlike a smartphone where the multiple cracks does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not hinder functionality the manufacturer s service is abyssmal and rude they claim to have a zero defect manufactured product a very bold and unheard of claim and would not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not replace or repair w o a fee will not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not buy again unless it has been tested and shown to be able to handle a little roughness since day to day use was more than it could handle without falling apart
