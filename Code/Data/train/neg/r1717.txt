i ordered this 2 1 because my work has me traveling to individual homes requiring me to work out of a bag this computer fits nicely into an over the shoulder satchel and has the benefit as working as a tablet and laptop it is a little slow transferring from laptop to tablet mode and when the tablet is used in a vertical position the image does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not adjust properly to fully fit the screen i specifically chose this 2 1 because it had a lot of the features of a laptop and i was not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not disappointed i especially like that it has an hdmi 2usb and a memory card slot i almost primarily use it as a laptop because it seems to function the best in this mode in addition there are limited apps available for this device so using it as a tablet has not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not been overly beneficial however i still like the option it works pretty fast has great storage and the compatibility make it a great choice
