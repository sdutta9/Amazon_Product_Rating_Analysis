my parents were looking to retire their 15 year old desktop and were interested in some around the house portability this unit provided that with it being rugged enough to take a few bumps here and there the touch screen is very responsive and keyboard track pad both perform well i didn t get to spend a significant amount of time with the unit but they have found it to meet their needs and more this would be a good unit for someone heading off to college but it is by no means a unit for lots of travel it s a bit heavy but not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not as heavy as some the i5 processor performs well with office and general programs in windows 8 1 without any lag it s well worth the money
