i had a old dell with a cd drive instead of a dvd drive i never at any point said i will never buy another dell when i wanted a new desktop i bought a dell it had no volumn to it which i figure was due to it being from the bottom of the price range and i do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not like windows 7 which is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not dells fault i had this for several months and never said i will never buy another dell i decided i wanted a laptop with wireless internet as i did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not have the money to get internet service and with windows xp i read the reviews and when i saw that it was a dell referbished by dell i bought one i will never buy another dell the left mouse button constantly clicks by itself i had to reverse the buttons to be able to use it at all even then it causes a lot of problems when i am writing e mails and other things when i turn it on the windows logo comes up and after a while the screen goes grey half the time the computer continues normally but about half the time the computer just sits there and grinds i have to hold the button down until it goes off i am on a fixed income which it why i buy low priced computers it hurts to have to put money aside to repair a refurished computer some people trade in their computers because they need or want something new others trade in their computers because something is about to break and they do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not want to have to get it fixed you buy these machine it is a crap shoot as to what you are going to get dell does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not refurbish them they just reinstall the old software and they do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not care it you are ripped off by them
