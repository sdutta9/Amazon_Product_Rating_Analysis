let me tell you that for about couple of months after purchasing this tablet i was quite happy it had some issues like partitioned memory which was a handicap in down loading applications i thought that additional sd card memory should help but it did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not by default the applications download to memory and it is quite less after use of a couple months i found that the screen froze and i could not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not restart the tablet even after complete reset when i contacted the technical support from matricom they told me that this is a known problem they agreed to replace the tablet though i had to mail it back on my cost the replacement tab ran only for a couple of weeks and the screen started scrolling i contacted support again and they asked me to mail the defective tablet back after i mailed the defective tablet back i got a tablet with shattered scree by the time i was pretty upset and fed up with the exchange process i requested them for a full refund and they agreed to refund me that way i am impressed by the matricom support however i am not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not too sure about the quality of the product so my rating about the product would be a 2 star
