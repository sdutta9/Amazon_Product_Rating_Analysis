i just got this computer today i might update it to windows 10 as i have used it before and i liked it i will make a disk backup first however now the one thing i really dislike so far is the power plug the newer power plugs are l shaped so they do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not stick out so far from the computer this computer plug sticks out very far from the computer seems backwards to me the screen i like and the screen is bright enough the touch screen works very good i tried hydro thunder via touch and it worked well enough the track pad is good i used it and had no issues with it my other nit pick is the lack of lights on the front it has one power button on the front that lights up it has no hard drive active light on it the lid is textured on the front and plain when you open it up it has little to no start up nag programs just the basics no trial stuff like anti virus that will expire in 30days so thats a big plus the keyboard feels a little mushy to me its good just not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not great this is a good all purpose computer it is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a gaming machine i bought this computer for work and play to buy a laptop that can play the top of the line games would require me to spend a lot more then i would like i spent 417 and for a new gaming laptop would be double this if not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not more the hard drive speed is average i should add that the setup was very easy i could find no dead pixels so far so good the one other thing that might bug people is the display has a lot of flex to it doesnt feel super tough should be fine i would open it up by the middle part only adults should have no issues with this kids and anyone who is tough on computers may want to look elsewhere i did try a video game just to see what kind of performance i would get i played f1 2014 on this laptop because i can benchmark it native resolution almost all settings to low the result was a frames per second of 24 the system requirements for this game intel core 2 duo 2 4ghz and memory 2 gb ram i did manage to get 26fps with the more memory at all settings to low still running strong mousepad is a complaint for others i think its fine speakers are about average for a laptop updated i recently went and bought an 8gb memory card it makes the game run a few frames better at 26fps so it does help with games
