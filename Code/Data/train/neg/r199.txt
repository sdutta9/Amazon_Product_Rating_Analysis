i did my research before i bought it so i knew what i was getting into to be fair i really do like the hardware and the os is decent enough once you get used to it that being said be prepared to be disappointed in the applications available for the surface 2 they are horribly designed particularly if you have ever used the itunes equivalent application example ebay app for apple allows you to track shipping of purchases not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not so for the windows app in fact for several of these apps it just opens an explorer window and takes you to the website with a split screen when you try to utilize a function gee thanks for nothing i could do that on my own without wasting drive space with a useless app however to be fair i wanted a very portable tablet my pc laptop is 17 that came with the office suite so a lack of quality support apps didn t really turn me off to it i still liked my surface 2 a lot for three whole weeks then it died i returned it through fedex as they instructed so i could get my replacement after a few days i chatted with their tech support to receive an eta for my replacement they gave me an eta and told me they would send me tracking information when it shipped the eta came and went no tracking information i contacted them again and was told that the replacement surface was definitely in the mail i asked for tracking information they said they couldn t give it because the storms were delaying shipments i pointed out that the storms would not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not have effected fedex giving them a tracking number it would only effect the speed of the delivery itself it took 2 hours of tech support chat to get them to confess that they had no idea if it had shipped or not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not they were just assuming it had so here i sit no surface 2 no tracking information i can but assume i will eventually get my replacement surface 2 however i just want to warn other potential customers many people have had their surface 2s mysteriously stop working if and when that happens you will have to deal with their customer service this is what you can expect still i must admit i really did like my surface 2 sigh
