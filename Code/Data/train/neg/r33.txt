i strongly recommend you do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not buy this product or any other model of microsoft surface as someone who has always used windows vista to 8 1 and has had several laptops that run windows i had high expectations from this device however it has become very apparent to me that microsoft is currently incapable of producing a working mobile platform problems unlike a pc this device is incapable of opening and or running programs and exe files downloaded from the internet the only programs that will work on this device are ones downloaded from the windows store which has a laughably small selection compared to the google play store the apple app store and even the amazon app store there are almost no apps utility programs or games available for this platform and the vast majority of what is available is neither well known or of good quality because the only programs available for use are ones downloaded from the severely understocked windows store the only browser you can use is internet explorer which is rather slow and clunky and is a privacy nightmare the device is generally lacking in user customization and preference settings the device crashes regularly especially when streaming video or watching videos online and often takes close to an hour to restart internet connectivity is unreliable and wi fi networks are slow to detect and connect to downloads are slow and do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not always complete even with the wi fi i pay for with a constant 1gbps bit rate the touchscreen is laggy and sometimes freezes for minutes at a time when typing on the touch keyboard and does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not work well with a stylus the magnetic connections for the charging cable and folding keyboard are cool in theory but are extremely prone to connection issues causing the charging cable to connect and even the indicator light to come on sometimes but not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not charge the device often when the keyboard is attached neither the keys nor mouse actually input and the device does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not auto sleep when the cover is closed the speed and effectiveness of charging quickly and noticeably decreases over time the device s battery is drained very quickly from a full charge even with moderate use the trackpad on the keyboard cover is hard to even locate much less use it is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not nearly sensitive enough and doesn t usually function properly when the right or left buttons are pressed or the pad is double tapped even the physical buttons power lock volume and home do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not always function and require more force to actuate than they should the connection of the headphone 3 5mm jack is faulty and delicate with all headphones and earbuds i ve tried and has little to no physical retention of the male jack the design is flimsy even with careful use and handling the silver gray coating chips scratches and even peels very easily and the un reinforced corners dent and chip the screen also is very delicate and seems to be far more prone to scratching cracking and smudging than other touchscreen devices such as my samsung galaxy note 4 which has been used and abused for almost a year and is literally in the same condition as it was fresh out of the box and is rather difficult to clean with a lint free cloth benefits it has a usb slot which is uncommon in tablets the kickstand is a nice feature the only truly useful well made programs on the platform are microsoft office programs word excel powerpoint outlook and onenote are fully functional in their mobile format in my opinion this device is only functional for using microsoft office programs and very light web browsing which does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not include playing videos viewing high quality pictures or gifs or downloading files of any kind i personally think you would be better off with any other tablet laptop or large smartphone
