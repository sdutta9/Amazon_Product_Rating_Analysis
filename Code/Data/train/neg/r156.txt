in the six months i have owned this tablet i ve had a total of 40 minutes use of it i bought it to use while travelling on business so i wouldn t have to lug my laptop around with me it has never worked for what i needed it for the first time i tried to turn it on after bringing it home it wouldn t go on i brought it back and the store gave me a new one a week later again it wouldn t go on i brought it in again and this time the sales person was able to get it working but while i was waiting someone else came in with the same problem the first time i took it on a business trip i tried to turn it on and i got an error message saying it needed a recovery code a couple of times i ve used it for 20 minutes but was unable to open attachments in either word or excel though the tablet is supposed to have the complete programs for both all told i ve spent four hours getting help at the store and five hours on the phone with microsoft technical support and they ve never solved my connectivity problem or my attachments problem the people at the store where i bought it said i have to download a whole new operating system as well as 17 other upgrades only problem is my machine can t find the upgrades in my house because it can t connect to my network even though it s in the same room with my computer which connects just fine i d like to trash the machine but it cost too much and they won t give me my money back even though i have an extended warranty they ll just give me another one and i don t want the headache it s already drained 15 hours of my time that i d much rather have spent on other things it s full of great ideas and the graphics are beautiful but in its current incarnation it just doesn t work
