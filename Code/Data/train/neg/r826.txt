it s everything i expected in a laptop except for the weight it s a bit on the heavy side and may not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not be fun to log around but i bought this system for my wife and she loves it with 6gb of ram it s quite fast and the touch screen option is also great i love dell products hope this helps someone who may want to purchase oh excellent delivery rate by amazon i gave this 4 stars only on account of the weight otherwise it s a great buy
