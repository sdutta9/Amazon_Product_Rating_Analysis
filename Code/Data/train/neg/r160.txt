best tablet i ve used the programs run great and is easy to use having the option between a typical microsoft desktop interface or the new windows is awesome you can even use both side by side i use that feature often i definitely recommend the surface 2 keyboard the keys feel like real buttons without the bulk i couldn t imagine not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not having my surface 2 the only negative is you can t use the surface pro pen only a stylus design
