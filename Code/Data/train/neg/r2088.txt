i ve had this for about a month and i m very happy with it excellent purchase for the price i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a gamer so i can not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not give any info on that but i ve had no issues streaming anything from netflix hulu you tube etc i suspect many of the other people that complained of that may have actually been experiencing issues with their internet service as opposed to their laptop the touch screen works great though i only use it for a few things the keyboard size is fine with me but it has a few things i would prefer to be changed mostly with the function keys and the lack of a light on the caps lock button personal preferences i really wasn t crazy about the texture of the exterior when i first got it but i don t even notice it now
