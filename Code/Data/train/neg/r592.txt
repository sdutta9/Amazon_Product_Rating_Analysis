not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not sure how this laptop is worth 500 and on sale for 350 perhaps they are trying to get rid of stock because of oversupply i ran into a variety of issues with this laptop for one the display is grainy as hell its absolute ass sorry but when i view videos at 1080p and it looks like 360p at best on a good day 720p something is wrong next on the outside the laptop looks sturdy however when you open it the laptop feels so cheap and a poor man s plastic very questionable in addition to this the keys sometimes don t work when you press them you have to press down extra hard and its just too much of an inconvenience to extend that i have to talk about the battery charging or the lack thereof constantly says 34 plugged in but not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not charging 34 i lose about 1 battery a day and finally sometimes the screen flickers and the colours change looking very washed out then quickly back to normal not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not sure if i got a lemon or not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not but there are just too many issues with this laptop with that said i can not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not recommend this or else i d be fooling myself and others which i can not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not afford to do
