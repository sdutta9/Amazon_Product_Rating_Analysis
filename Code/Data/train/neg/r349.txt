the thing that kills this device s usefulness is the memory yes it has 16gb of internal memory 15gb of which is an internal non removable sd card only 1 gb of real flash memory and every app takes up some of that internal memory and some won t let you move them to the sd card at all so very quickly the device s internal memory is full and you can t install more apps so the specifications are misleading and end up leaving you with a device that is woefully weak for real use
