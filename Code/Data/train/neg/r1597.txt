at this price point you may be hoping to use this as a family or kids laptop don t really just don t bother it does work but it s clunky and a bit painful to use with the combo of windows 8 and a monitor that s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not touch screen pros it does turn on and it does run windows os products large monitor for a laptop cons it s quite slow not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not surprising but i do have to say it and remember to give it time to fully wake up i sometimes type in my password about 6 times before it was ready to listen to anything the keyboard had to say the lack of a touchscreen both means that windows 8 is crazy challenging to use and kids who are used to a more normal windows 8 environment will poke this monitor repeatedly damaging it won t play some games like the sims which my kids love again not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not surprising but i do have to say it no included antivirus or office software look for cheap alternatives for the latter you could check out google docs libreoffice apache openoffice calligra suite oxygenoffice professional softmaker office or feng office community edition the touchpad is annoying and super easy to bump by accident mid typing windows 8 means that unless you spend some serious time cleaning up your home screen it s covered with clutter some apps like weather are great but you can t uninstall the store or easily hide it from your kids gah and even some things like ebay ebay for my 7 year old and the default health and fitness icon has me just cringing for the day it will offer tips for a great sex life again ok for an adult not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not so much for a young kid and amazon sports and adobe junk are things that really would just be better banished for a family computer but they re hard to get rid of windows 8 means your kids will need their own email addresses from day one if they re young you don t have to tell them the address or its associated password but you ll need one to get them logged in since win8 will sync bookmarks programs etc across all your machines and you neither want your child accessing your own bookmarks nor do you want them accessing say your personal writing or family budget files and deciding to give them an overhaul or maybe erase them so set up a separate account for them and use it instead of your own there are no manuals so you ll need to have a second machine open both as you re setting this up and as you re using it over time so you can ask google how to do everything from the most basic to the most complex functions memorizing keyboard shortcuts will help but ultimately you re going to need an extra machine to walk you step by step through instructions for getting things done on this one it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not all dell s fault this is so hard to use microsoft does share some of that blame but still i really can t recommend this product if you re curious do a search for cpubenchmark amd a6 6310 apu with amd radeon r4 graphics yes cpubenchmark as one word they actually give this a zero score
