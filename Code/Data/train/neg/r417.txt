great laptop alternative but i find it a little bit heavy to carry around not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not like an ipad overall i find it great that it runs full windows and full office windows applications i also find boot times very fast and the screen is very responsive overall solid build quality and decent battery life not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not sure i would replace my laptop with this but it is great to haul around on trips
