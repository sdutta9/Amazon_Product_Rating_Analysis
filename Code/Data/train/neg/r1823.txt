i ll just cut to the chase and tell you my experience maybe yours will be similar does it work with windows 10 yes i upgraded right out of the box and it only took an hour or so windows 10 so far is mostly awesome coming from windows 7 some menus are a bit more annoying to personalization but it s been smoother overall before i upgraded i spent some time personalizating things in windows 8 and i thought that worked very well with the touchscreen going to windows 10 it feels like you lose some touch features like being able to swipe in from the side of the screen to bring up the start menu windows 10 is more like windows 7 than windows 8 which is great but means some touch features go somewhat underutilized is it fast yes and no it s fast in the sense that browsing the web is near instant and programs open quickly however i find that moving files around through the explorer often lags for a few seconds it could be the os cold boot time from when i open the lid to when i m on my desktop is an average 15 seconds is it heavy it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not light but it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not heavy it s slim however so it feels good to hold and carry despite being rather large is the fan quiet and cool it rarely gets loud or hot until you re doing something like rendering or downloading when it does however it is loud and hot does it have a cd drive nope i don t remember the last time i used one and i don t think you ll miss it fortunately you can always pick one up separately how many usb ports does it have 3 one on the left and two on the right the headphone mic port is also on the right i plug my graphic tablet in the left and my mouse and external on the right how is the battery i get around 4 5 hours on low brightness and less on high brightness especially when doing intensive computing if you re browsing with low settings it ll last longer fortunately the power cable is pretty long how is the screen it gets really bright but it runs down the battery faster if you turn it up higher the touchscreen is amazing but your fingerprints will stay on the screen so be sure to wipe them off it s glossy not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not matte and it does reflect some of the background as for the resolution it s great to have more things on the screen at once but more often than not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not i find everything to be way too small i ve zoomed in on half of my webpages because i can t read anything the full hd resolution with true colors is great though made me realize a lot of things i were creating weren t calibrated correctly how is the audio the speakers are loud i never turn my volume up more than 20 unfortunately if you go all the way up it distorts the sound you shouldn t have a problem letting friends or family hear videos or music but don t blow the speakers how is the keyboard typing on this thing is amazing it s quiet and it feels comfortable the keys are flat and very close to the board so it has an overall smooth texture for some reason the numlock doesn t have a light on it while caps lock dose so i never know when i have it turned on as for the backlit keyboard there are 3 settings bright less bright and off and i usually keep it on the less bright option there is no 34 low 34 setting unfortunately but it s made typing in the dark so much better the function keys are very useful but be sure to turn off function lock so you can use f5 to refresh browsers again you wont know it s on or off because no light for some reason how is the touchpad honestly it s absolute garbage the build quality of the lower half of the laptop isn t too sturdy so i am able to click the mouse by flexing the lower end of the frame this means that if i m lying down in bed and the laptop is slightly bent the mouse will often count that as a 34 click 34 it s beyond frustrating additionally it s just too damn big and it feels like your hand has to be placed in an unnatural location to use it right clicking is annoying because of how far down it is on the laptop the multi touch gestures were cool and i want to keep them on but i disabled them because it s easy to accidentally touch the laptop with your thumbs it s useable but you will be annoyed the good thing is you have a touchscreen for when you re lying in bed and tablet mode is pretty cool in windows 10 so you don t feel useless without the mousepad you should buy a separate one though if you re doing anything intensive how is the graphics card it s decent and probably better than any old computer you are using but it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not going to handle high end gaming or streaming and probably wont be able to handle intensive video editing at high resolutions i ve had the display driver crash twice while using sony vegas 13 it reboots itself however is it upgradeable it looks like you can upgrade everything except the cpu and gpu which are soldered onto the motherboard like all intel processors what programs do you use i m just going to run through everything i have installed microsoft edge it s basically ie with new paint but it doesn t have add on support yet so it s barebones good for lightweight stuff i suppose google chrome works as you expect i can open 100 tabs and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not have my pc die on me fl studio 12 works great with touchscreen definitely fun to use in a social setting sony vegas 13 you can render in full hd and edit clips in real time without your files skipping it s a lot of fun and my display driver has only had a few minor issues paint tool sai it works but sai was never good at handling big files and it doesn t seem like the extra ram helps much i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not sure if it s the 32 bit version or just switching the os but i m having more problems with larger canvas sizes than i did before photoshop cs6 works well including with 3d google sketchup lags sometimes but otherwise does fine skype i can keep it open in the background and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not watch my cpu tank bittorrent download away halo custom edition runs well in 720p at 30fps you can tinker with some other things but the game crashes if you try to max it out itunes works well especially with the play and skip buttons on the function keys xsplit broadcaster i m new to pc streaming but xsplit seemed to be having trouble broadcasting at full hd because of the graphics chip being integrated take of that what you will media player classic works well apps all of the apps are handy and some are quicker than booting up the browser the twitter app is especially cool to use i don t like the photo app though it works well with the touchscreen if you re showing photo albums but for browsing folders i d rather use the old photo app or picture and fax viewer if i can figure out how to download it overall i think it s a great laptop the biggest problems are really the integrated gpu and the mouse pad but it s otherwise a solid buy at this price feel free to ask questions
