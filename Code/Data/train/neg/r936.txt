i would say that this laptop is good for what s it worth however there is an issue that i came across since the start the icons are blurred out and the text is so small has anyone tried to fix this i want to know if i had bought the right laptop or i received a defective version other than that i tried to gaming on it league of legends and the performance is playable at 30fps but once it drops to 20fps i just had it with the gaming i guess the xps can only be used for school purposes but i want a pleasant experience with it and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not be irritated by a minor issue of blurred imaging icons
