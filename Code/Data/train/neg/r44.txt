i never thought i d have to write this kind of review but here it goes i honestly do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not understand why this thing has so many great reviews i bought it last year at a best buy in my area and its sole purpose was for taking notes writing papers research and printing that s it that s all i wanted it for but it literally can t even handle that at first i really thought this tablet had a lot of appeal being fully loaded with all the microsoft programs i need as a college student i thought it was an ingenious idea every college student should have in their bags i was fully on board the windows microsoft bandwagon and my family and i were so excited we bought 2 one for my stepsister and i initially out of the box and through a couple documents it wasn t so bad sure the formatting was weird to me i have an iphone so other tablet formats are foreign to me and i found it actually really hard to navigate everything seemed to get lost or deleted and i had no idea how it was happening or what i was personally doing wrong it improved after a few uses and i thought it was pretty helpful in classes but the one major flaw is the printing process i have older printers in my home that seem completely incompatible with the rt system that was one thing that really made me mad because even tho i had all my documents right there i could not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not for the life of me get them to print winter break rolled around and i stopped using the tablet and letting it frustrate me but the following semester i only encountered more problems oh great to start it would open and close things randomly would not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not properly save documents and seemed to have a trillion updates everytime i turned the thing on notes could never be done in class and it even started deleting things that i had typed and closing unsaved documents to never be recovered i stopped using the writing feature at this point and went back to my grandpa of a computer whose snail like speed was less frustrating than the tablets inability to function lately i ve been trying to get things done for school and now its decided that all internet webpages have expired or have expired licensing or expired security or whatever and even tho it offers to allow you to bypass the notification it leads you no where i am so fudging tired of this tablet giving me nothing but problems it s literally the biggest waste of time energy and money i have ever spent wish i could get my college funds back because this is junk do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not buy
