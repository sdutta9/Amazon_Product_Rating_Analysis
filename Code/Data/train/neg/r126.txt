better than the surface rt but still win 8 rt the new os is better more apps are there but still lacking no alternate browsers because microsoft won t allow it so you re stuck with ie in two flavors ms is pretty restrictive allowing third party development which will kill this product eventually ie is still two different versions the crappy touch version which doesn t work well the real desktop version but some of the flash issues have been resolved but the touch version will still not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not do rss feeds like the desktop version does things were fine until horizontal static started on the display and the sd card started corrupting so as with the surface rt i had back it went for a refund
