this laptop serves all my needs and expectations for a low priced laptop with generous features 802 11ac bluetooth gigabit ethernet win 10 preinstalled full hd screen even vga out but i can not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not imagine using this computer for any number of years day in and day out without some kind of status indicator for caps lock and num lock there is nothing not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not even feedback at the instant of toggle which could warn of an accidental toggle a not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not uncommon occurrence otherwise i would rate this maybe 3 stars the keyboard is inconsistent with too frequent key presses not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not recording the touchpad is inconsistent with the two fingered gestures for scrolling and resizing
