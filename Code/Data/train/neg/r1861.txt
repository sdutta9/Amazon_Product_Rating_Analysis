i got this laptop through the bank credit reward points value 600 the laptop is made with cheap material and so it looks much cheaper compared with a toshiba laptop in the same price range i often have to repeat typing because the buttons are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not precise enough it runs slow from the beginning the set up dell online registration has never functioned the cd tray must be pushed 3 4 times until it can be opened for use so disappointed i will go back to toshiba
