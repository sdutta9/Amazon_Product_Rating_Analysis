i love it its operating system is windows 7 professional which is my favorite i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not really into windows 8 or 10 for some reason it has 1tb hard drive and it runs real fast and smooth also the screen size is 15 6 the biggest screen size you can get from a laptop one drawback is it weighs 5lbs which is a little heavy for me to carry overall i still tend to give it a five star
