i am giving this laptop 5 stars as this really is a great value overall on the positive side my 34 refurbished 34 laptop arrived in extremely great shape with no discernible scratches and fully functional i went ahead and checked the internals as well not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not for your average home user and it was very clean my particular unit was manufactured in may of 2012 and i am thinking it did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not have a lot of mileage to it it does come with a new clean installation of windows 7 64 bit professional ready to boot up and install the battery seemed in good shape and passed the dell website battery diagnostic test in addition while these machines are out of original warranty 3 years the dell website is full of easy to use support options even offering an extended warranty if you wish to pay for it a machine like this refurbished from dell proper will run 700 to 800 you might want to read the reviews on the dell e6420 on the web as it is a robust laptop made for travel and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not made of egg shells fantastic machine on the critical side my unit came with the i5 2410m intel sandy bridge processor and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the i5 2520 as advertised and the i5 2410m is slightly slower with a base of 2 3 ghz and turbo boost sustained of 2 8 ghz in addition the 4 gb of ram 2 x 2 gb modules were miss matched in speed so they were only running at 533 mhz and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not 667 mhz i went ahead and changed them out to new 2 new corsair ram modules at 4 gb for a total of 8 gb dual channel memory now running at 800 mhz i was not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not crazy about the old samsung 128 gb ssd that came with the laptop so i changed it out to a new toshiba 256 gb q series pro ssd and i ran an additional clean install of windows 7 64 bit professional the new ram and new ssd made a reasonably fast laptop even faster you can use this laptop for very demanding applications without the computer lagging or slowing down the only area this laptop might fall short on would be for intensive graphics associated with complex pc games 3d rendering or intense video editing for most business and home applications this laptop will more then keep up keep in mind that if you need any additional drivers or support you can get it all at the dell website i went ahead and updated the bios and checked for the most up to date drivers off of the dell website also be prepared to take some time on the first install of windows 7 that there will be about 200 to 220 updates needed almost immediately once you get the machine up and running and hooked up to the internet on the bright side you did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not get a new laptop with a 34 ton 34 of stupid bloatware and junk you did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not want or need these dell machines do come in slightly different configurations and are being sold by different secondary vendors mine came from techharvard but there are 2 or 3 other vendors selling these as well under this same heading while i feel very positive about buying this refurbished laptop and i know i got an excellent value individual results may vary quite frankly i would buy this machine again and i would buy this refurbished dell laptop ahead of most of the new junk that you can find in the retail stores if you are on a budget and you need a great laptop you could not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not go wrong buying this unit if you are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not on a budget go ahead and get the new dell e6440 laptop but be prepared to fork over 1 200 or so for the privilege trust me the dell e6440 is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not going to perform much better then this refurbished e6420 and if the new e6440 comes with a standard hard drive instead of an ssd it will be a slower machine if in doubt just buy it
