this is a very good laptop i ve used it about a month and i really like it here are some specific comments 1 touchscreen if you have an ipad it is very intuitive it is easy to add and remove apps to the start screen if you have a question on how to do things you can easily google and find an answer 2 touchpad i don t like touch pads and this one is as bad as the rest my solution disabled it and used a wireless mouse i alternate between using it and the touchscreen feature 3 speed for a moderately priced laptop it is really fast it takes about 10 seconds to load up 4 preloaded stuff there are lots of dell apps that are pre loaded on the start screen you can easily 34 unpin 34 them and put the stuff you use most often on the screen windows 8 1 makes it a snap to do this 5 the default browser is explorer no surprise here but if you want to add an application like gmail to the start screen you can do it only by using explorer rather than chrome 5 screen resolution not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not bad but certainly not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not hi def but what do you expect for a little over 500 are the speakers marginal sure they are use headphones or buy some small speakers to improve the sound as opposed to comments from others set up was a snap for me the wireless connection is very good
