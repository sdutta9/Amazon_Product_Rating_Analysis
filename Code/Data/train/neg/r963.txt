i like the form factor of this laptop however the poor quality of the trackpad and the keyboard make this laptop almost unusable for developers the battery life is also less than half the advertised time the problem with the touchpad is that it is very unresponsive and the keyboard registers frequently multiple keystrokes making typing a real pain after calling dell s customer support they sent me a replacement laptop but there was no improvement clearly this is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a laptop for professional use i am very frustrated with this purchase i should have bought another apple laptop instead where i have never experienced quality issues of this kind
