i bought this directly from dell via paypal the web site said delivery 2 5 days but it took 19 days to arrive i loved the machine when it arrived after 4 hours the sd card reader failed i tried all the usual stuff to fix it and dell web diagnostic tools as well all the tools said it was working ok but it was not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not working i noticed many people were having problems with the sd card reader on the internet dell only provided the basic reboot and reload drivers type advice seems like they did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not take it seriously it took dell 7 days to answer a request for refund and 30 days to do it this is the second dell machine i have had with early failure
