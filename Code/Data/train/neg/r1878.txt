this is probably a better laptop then i think it is i like the backlit key board i don t care about the touch screen but it is nice looking i missed the fact that it doesn t have a dvd player when i read the description on one occasion the screen had a lite pink background instead of white but at the next startup it was gone this was my first laptop and the thing that irritates me the most may be common on laptops every time i turned it on the number pad would not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not work until i pushed the num lock key there is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a light on it like on the caps lock key so i didn t know if the keys were on or off until i pushed a number i can t see any reason for the number pad to default to the off position when the laptop is shut off if there is a reason i don t know what it could be as far as i m concerned it s a pain in the butt i would rather have a laptop without the key pad rather then wonder whether or not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not it is going to work maybe it s a minor irritation to some but it s a major one to me by the way i typed this review on my desk top that happens to be a dell where the number pad always works
