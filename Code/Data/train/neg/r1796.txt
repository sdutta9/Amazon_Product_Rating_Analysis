i have had 6 different toshiba brand loyal you would say the last two satellite s i have possessed have destroyed the brand irrecoverably for me from poor hard drive function after 6 months to poorly managed adware into the operating system to the sin of 34 not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not allowing your user to customize how the touchpad works incase they don t like the bs of 34 inverted scroll 34 i purchased this unit not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not from amazon they would have let me return it invest in the prime account due to having about 5 similar toshiba chargers so i could keep one at my office one in my car and one in a bag for travel this again was a mistake and one i will regret after my last 34 ultrabook 34 purchase windows 8 does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not make this any easier to deal within save your cash get a chromebook as this unit is slower more problematic and takes longer to boot and will cost you more in the long run i am praying my update to either windows 10 will redeem the os or my swap to ubuntu linux will cause less long term problems
