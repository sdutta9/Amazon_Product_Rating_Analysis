i purchased five of these for work and set all of them up on all of them the startup time is slower than what i would expect for an i5 processor with 8 gb of ram even after i did a fresh install of windows it takes a few minutes for the network icon to appear in the system tray once it s up and running it seems to be fine but it is a bit slower than what i would expect from the processor and amount of ram available when i initially turned on the computers they would not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not connect to a wired ethernet connection only wifi the wired connection started working after i did a fresh install of windows i didn t try to find a fix because we always do a fresh install of windows to get rid of bloatware removing the dell installed driver and using the driver that comes with windows would probably fix the issue
