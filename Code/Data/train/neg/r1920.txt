the mouse pad on this laptop makes everything else mute this has been so frustrating that i have returned the laptop to dell for another one thinking there was something wrong with the mouse pad once i received my replacement from dell i had the same problems i ve adjusted the pressure but it doesn t seem to work basically every time i click on a page or try to drop a page down from my favorites folder it takes at least 5 or 6 tries before it works dell support could not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not fix this problem either apparently nothing is 34 wrong 34 with the laptop it s just how they make them now i had always bought dell laptops however after this one i will be looking for a different brand even now as i try to click the one star rating it just took me six times to do so
