up to last week i would have given the surface 2 a five star rating i have loved this device for the past year and five months my wife used it mostly and she loved it it was a very good device however just last week the touch screen just stopped working the device wasn t dropped or stepped on or damaged in any way it was working in the morning and when my wife brought it home from work it was totally unresponsive to the touch it was always kept in the sleeve that was bought with it when not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not in use luckily we can still use the device with the keyboard accessory but it has lost most of its appeal with the loss of touch sensation researching online i am not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the only one who has experienced this and the warranty for the device only lasts 1 year i feel short changed
