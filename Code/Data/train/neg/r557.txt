let me make it simple if you re a geek like me who knows about technology then you ll love it if you re that average guy like my brother then complete reading i ll review this device as a tablet without keyboard using it only by touch and a surface pen if you ll get the surface keyboard then don t complete reading i got this device for my brother who is an average user at first he was thinking of getting an ipad and then came to me and said i think the surface would be more useful for me cuz i can run apps like matlab which is a windows app that engineering students use for collage he said he wanted it for collage purposes like viewing slides web browsing and engineering apps i told him for these kind of apps you won t need the keyboard you can get only the surface pen for areas where you ll need that mouse pointer precision which you can t replace with your finger and save some cash by not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not getting the keyboard and he did note all problems mentioned below are software issues which can be solved in the future problem 1 windows 8 is confusing i think everyone knows how windows 8 is unfamiliar for users that are coming from windows 7 so there is a learning curve if you re gonna use windows 8 there is a lot of topics written on the web about that so i ll not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not talk more about it you can google it problem 2 not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not all apps that come preinstalled are touch optimised i can forgive other companies apps for not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not being touch optimised but not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not windows s own preinstalled apps even an app that you ll use a lot like file explorer isn t touch optimised i mean you can live with the fact that icons and right click menus are small to touch off course the surface pen helps in these ares but still that is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not good also it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not easy to select text in classic apps like notepad problem 3 the on screen touch keyboard do you know that behaviour when you use your smartphone and let s say you tapped on the text box to start typing and send a message to someone the keyboard will pop up automatically cuz it s common sense that you ll need it to type that doesn t happen on windows which is stupid you have to click on the show keyboard button every time you want to type something and you have to dismiss it manually also the keyboard only pops up automatically in touch optimised apps which are formally known as metro apps it s really embarrassing and funny at the same time that a company like microsoft can t address an issue like that problem 4 he changed his mind that day he told me i want to use adobe photoshop and adobe illustrator on it and here was the problem if you used these apps before then you definitely know that you need a keyboard to quickly switch between tools undo and redo actions and to use all the other essential shortcuts i googled it for him and i found an alternative for not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not having a keyboard which you can find here it s a nice tool that one guy on the internet did thank you sir i found it better than the other tool that another guy did which is called toolbar creator because toolbar creator doesn t provide a hold action after that he could use photoshop after going to photoshop settings and enabling 200 ui scaling which makes every thing a bit bigger to be easier to tap with the surface pen but unfortunately adobe illustrator doesn t have that option and every thing is so tiny so i can say it s unusable without a mouse illustrator has a stupid touch mode which makes it like kids app by taking a lot of features from you and making the ui so simple also illustrator does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not support palm rejection nor pinch to zoom but photoshop does when it comes to hardware there isn t too much to complain about the device is really well built it s in the level of a mac build quality only wished there was a 4th position for the kickstand just like that position which would be nice for drawing and writing but it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a big deal i can close the kickstand and lay it down on its back
