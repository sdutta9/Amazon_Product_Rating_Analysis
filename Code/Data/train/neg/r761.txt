i want to first mention that this is a signature edition laptop which means that this is a special edition made by dell that does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not have junkware or a bunch of 3rd party trial software i had already purchased it before knowing that but it was a very nice surprise to my absolute delight there was no 3rd party trial software other than mcafee there are a few dell things installed but nothing that is a bother i consider this a mid level laptop at a budget price i was shocked to find it at such a low price i bought mine at 449 00 maybe it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not quite a low low budget laptop but finding an i5 processor and 8gb ram for under 600 was impossible i wanted something that wouldn t be out of date or unable to handle upgrades in software in 3 years i was a little apprehensive because it seemed too good to be true and it only had 2 reviews at the time of purchase but after months of shopping and knowing this had powerful components i decided to go for it and am so glad i did if you can handle the extra 100 or so over the low budget laptops then get this one you are getting something that won t be out of date in a few years what i liked it has a 5th generation i5 processor hard to find in a budget laptop can even handle light gaming it has 8gb ram which can handle multiple loads on the system also hard to find on a budget laptop it starts up in about 10 seconds with everything ready to go it s light and extremely quiet you can barely hear the fan when it s running it has a 1 tb hard drive also hard to find in a budget laptop it automatically found my online printer and other computers in my home so setup was very very easy things it has but are a personal preference touch screen very cool but i hardly use the feature but it is nice to have windows 8 1 i understand the fuss about it being different but it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not hard to use and for me it s nice to have a desktop that is laid out in a similar fashion to a smartphone plus you can also have your traditional desktop plus with windows 10 being free next month it s kind of a moot point things i wish it had better screen resolution i say this but so far i have been happy with it it only has a 1366 x 768 resolution but is technically still considered high definition for me it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a big deal but most people want 1080p it s one reason for the affordability a optical drive even though i can t remember that last time i used a cd dvd drive i like to have one just in case the good news is that you can buy one for less than 30 that you connect via usb overall i definitely recommend this laptop i always buy dell and have never been disappointed i also think this is an amazing deal i had been shopping for months and as soon as i saw this i didn t hesitate i see the price has gone up a little but it s still a good deal you cannot find such specs for this price you won t regret it
