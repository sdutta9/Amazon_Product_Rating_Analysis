very disappointed the wifi card had issues the signal was so weak i had to stand next to the router to use it and even then i barely have one bar i called dell support and have been on the phone for over an hour the technical support agents tried updating drivers and the bios but no help i am extremely disappointed in this product and do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not recommend it others seems to have no problems so maybe it is hit or miss but when you miss it is terrible and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not worth the risk
