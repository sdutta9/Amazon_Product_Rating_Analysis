i got this laptop because i needed something portable to bring to school and something i can use to watch youtube and netflix i was at first very happy with this laptop it did exactly what i needed it to do however after 6 months the power button completely broke where internally it was not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not connected to the rest of the computer like the motherboard and it couldn t be fixed i didn t even have it for a year and it already broke even though i babied the thing i couldn t even get it replaced because toshiba only gives you a one month warranty which is really ridiculous since it was their faulty build of the device never buy this computer save your money
