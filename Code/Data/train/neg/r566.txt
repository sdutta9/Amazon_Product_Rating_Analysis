if you ever owned the macbook pro this thing is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not for you i ve been using macbookpro retina mid 2012 and i need windows to do some of my work as soon as i saw this one on the internet i preordered it the highest spec which almost costs me 3 00 after i got it small things started to bother me the touch pad move is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not as smooth as mbp s connecting to 2nd monitor always goes back to initial setup so i have to set up again as extended monitor windows 10 has too much small bugs maybe this is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not bug just unfriendly and ungraceful user interface which is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not critical but it is very inconvenient to do everyday jobs the pen is great i think this is better than ipad pro but there was not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not much thing to write or draw for me i really tried to like this laptop but after 3 weeks i gave up hardware itself is as good as apple s but the software is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not there yet i go back to mbp i still need windows laptop but i cannot find one maybe razer blade
