i am loving this new dell laptop the touchscreen and touchpad both are responsive and windows 8 really shines with the touchscreen i really like the finish both outer and screen keyboard pretty lightweight much lighter than my dell office laptop and sleek when closed not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not too hefty not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not too thin but just right the sound quality is just okay you will want to get bluetooth speaker s otherwise this is a great deal that s tough to beat
