i am a computer nerd that is i use computers constantly and i have taught myself how to fix most software and even hardware problems i last bought a computer 5 years ago got a great deal in another brand and have kept that computer up and running all that time myself this last week i decided to buy this dell going through amazon was the best deal with their free shipping and competitive pricing i spent about a day research this and similar computers in the mid range of pricing i needed power and some important features so i chose the dell because of generally good reviews and its power rating on various sites i got the computer in 2 days as promised and set about setting it up i found out early that the disk drive was not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not recognizing disks then when trying to register the dell the y key did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not work in the registration form i called tech support and began explaining after a 15 minute wait for service the call was immediately dropped and the tech guy from india did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not call back i called again and it took another 15 minutes to get to tech support this guy ronald really worked with me suggested some changes which he sent over email to me i began working on those but that did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not work i then went to dell support and began downloading updates ronald was still talking to me on email and suggested a bios update the bios that came was a03 and the machine was supposed to have a05 i began the update and hour later all the updates were done in the meantime i discovered that the disk drive region had not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not been specified at the factory i set for region 1 us ronald called me back at 11 30 pacific time and ask how it was going the bios update had worked so the disk drive was working and i was installing software fine my rating for the tech support is an a but for the initial setup of the computer it has to be a d because my updates should have been done in the factory or before they shipped the unit for those who are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not somewhat tech savvy i suggest another vendor for those who can spend 4 hours and do most of the work yourself then this is the computer for you the y problem righted itself after i restarted my question is are vendors so concerned about shipping the units fast that they are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not setting them up appropriately before they ship is this what we can expect in the future because if so i might make other choices personal purchase
