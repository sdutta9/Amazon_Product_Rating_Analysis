fast and good machine i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not crazy about the way the mouse pad works but i also haven t had time to check it out either i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not crazy about windows 10 and the way it functions but that is no reflection on the hardware sound could be significantly louder though easy to use and get started with no issues at this time i like the touch screen feature and the battery life is really good nice size screen too
