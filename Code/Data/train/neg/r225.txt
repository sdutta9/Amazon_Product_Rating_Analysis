i ve been looking for a tablet that i can also use for productivity such as word excel i have an ipad and although it is great it s hard to use it for productivity i bought the surface 2 hoping it would solve my problem and it pretty much did the windows titles are a nice change to ios icons and i like how they update with new text photos for top stories etc i also like that the apps take advantage of the full size screen a criticism of mine toward ios and android apps is that they are heavily text based built with cell phones in mind and do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not take advantage of large tablet screens this is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the case here i also purchased the kindle fire hdx and although the build is fantastic the colors are amazing unfortunately the apps are lacking and productivity is out of the question if you want to use it for media consumption only it would be my first choice the disadvantage of the surface is that there aren t a lot of apps available also there are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not many cases to choose from the screen is pretty impressive but the contrast and color richness is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not as a good as the hdx or retina screens also the keyboards aren t cheap and when added to the price it gets close to the ipad in terms of cost however the surface keyboards are more comfortable for those with large hands as they take advantage of the the screen s additional width that is absent on the hdx ipad as a plus this came with 200gb for 2 years of skydrive saving me 240 on my dropbox subscription a 25 app store gift card and a years worth of free skype calling
