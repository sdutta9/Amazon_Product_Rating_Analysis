i really want to like this laptop the screen is nice the construction feels above par for the price the keyboard feels good and is nicely lit its not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not too heavy but the trackpad is beyond frustrating the trackpad is made of some sort of rubbery plastic textured grippy material that prevents your fingers from gliding smoothly across its surface this makes the cursor jumpy forget trying to scroll down a page you know when you do that two finger drag the cursor jumps all over yes i tried disabling the zoom in zoom out feature this is because your fingers literally sticks to the pad fine they dont stick and then not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not move but its like trying to move your finger over a piece of rubbery grippy sandpaper ok ok thats a little bit of an exaggeration its not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not just like sandpaper but do you get the point you try to move the cursor just a little bit for precise small movements and you end up moving too much because you have to add extra pressure to get your fingers to move you try to move the cursor a lot and you re all over the place because you can t judge when you need to stop because the grippy texture prevents a linear feel this has nothing to do with sensitivity of the trackpad or drivers there is no 34 your motherboard is defective 34 here people it is the material the trackpad is made out of grippy sandpaper i know i have said it before my macbook pro has a glass like feel to the track pad so its nice and smooth with just enough resistance so you re not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not all over the screen but thats a premium laptop oh wait even my wife s 200 hp chromebook has that glass like trackpad with just the just right amount of resistance like i have said i want to like this laptop its got all the right ingredients except for that dang trackpad which drives me absolutely crazy and no thanks to the 34 go buy a mouse 34 people the laptop should not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not need a work around to have precise cursor movements without having to watch the cursor jump all over the screen because texture of the trackpad prevents a smooth linear feel
