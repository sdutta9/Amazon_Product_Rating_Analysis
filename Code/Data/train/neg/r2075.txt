i bought this so i could stick it in a bag and use when i go out to set up routers access points etc the screen is very small i know it is the same size as a tablet but for some reason it is much harder to read this also makes it difficult to touch the correct point the battery will not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not hold any charge and i have to plug it in every time i want to use it after two weeks of trying i put it away i ll find someone who has no computer to give it to i m sure they will appreciate it but for me a computer professional it was a waste of money
