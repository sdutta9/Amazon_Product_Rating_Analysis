this computer is great for the price i have had it for almost a year now and it s great for what i need it for i would have rated five stars but unfortunately my hard drive crashed after three months of use dell replaced it for free but after almost three weeks of not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not having a computer and dealing with the worst customer service i have ever dealt with
