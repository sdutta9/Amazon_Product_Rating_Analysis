i was extremely excited to get my hands on a sp4 i ve only owned mine for 3 days at the tone of this review but i ve had many problems already so far it has crashed on me twice while taking pictures in the one note app 3 different times it wouldn t wake from sleep and i had yo do hard restarts and now 2 times touch stopped working and i had to restart to regain touch functions also cortana would not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not pick up my voice one time which i also had to restart to correct i hate writing a bad review for something i wanted so badly but it seems microsoft has a bunch of kinks that they didn t bother ironing out maybe my unit is just defective i will update if i send in for a replacement
