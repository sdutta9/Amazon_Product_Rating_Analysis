excellent value at 350 especially with a full hd screen intel i3 with 5th gen cpu has enough horsepower for most non gaming needs 4gb is also sufficient if not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not exactly spacious but it s a lead pipe cinch to add another 4gb remove one screw and open the door on the back takes one minute literally only real negative is the hdd a 5400 rpm no less hdds are slower than molasses in january so i d strongly recommend yanking the hdd and installing an ssd you can get the crucial bx100 250gb right here for 80 250gb not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not enough the 500 gb is around 160 then delete mcafee a massive pig and other bloatware and you ll have a laptop that boots up in mere seconds warning installing the ssd is substantially more complicated if you aren t comfortable taking apart a laptop and tinkering with its parts then get a friend to do it who is the reward is worth it
