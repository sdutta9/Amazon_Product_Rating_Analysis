i like that it is small and light though i probably won t use the tablet or presentaton mode it is moderately fast and easily carried at first the touchpad interfered with my typing as i was unable to keep my thumb from brushing against it and causing the courser to move but i was able to uninstall the touchpad i use a mouse anyway and now it reaads that the touchpad is inactive because it has detected another device my mouse i would recommend it
