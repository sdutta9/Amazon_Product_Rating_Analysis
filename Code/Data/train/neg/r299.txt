so far so good one of the things i loved about this pc was that dell did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not load it down with a bunch of free trial software also the dell utilities for maintaining speed of the pc are useful it does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not come equipped with an ethernet plug but you can get a 3rd party adaptor that plugs into one of the available usb ports such as anker and it works great so far if this pc keeps running the way it is now it will be one of the best pcs i have ever owned
