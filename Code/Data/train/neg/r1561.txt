i hate this computer the wifi keeps booting me off my mouse jumps around in the middle of me typing and i end up writing in other places if i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not paying attention i take online classes and when i have an exam it is important that i stay online the entire time because i get no breaks once the 2 hour exam has started i got booted off in the middle and had to settle for the score i received i cracked the screen on my asus with the celeron processor and thought this would be an upgrade i miss my asus but i m stuck with this until i can afford another one this year even right now as i m writing this i got booted off my internet i am so disappointed
