i wrote a review previously about this lap top and i am surprised that i did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not get any feedback my laptop came quickly i do have amazon prime so it arrived on time everything works well except for one thing from the first day i connected my computer there was some discomfort between my hand and the extreme bottom of the laptop i was not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not sure what it was but it felt hollow and would make a crackling sound if i pressed on it this went on for months however about a month ago i saw a tiny black screw right below my laptop just sitting there on the table i was stunned and wondered where could that have come from i mean my laptop was purchased on august 5 surely it couldn t be falling apart to my surprise it was to my even more surprise one was already missing i went on to check the rest and all were loose unbelievable i then went on to tighten the screws that were left since then the crackling sound is no more i am utterly disappointed my laptop could have fallen apart and then what you mean every screw was loose who does that i know that it came that way because from the very first time i turned my laptop on i had this issue but thought i was paranoid i do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not know what else is wrong because of this but i hate that i received a defective laptop a product should be received in tact and i believe that it is mere carelessness to release an item without thoroughly checking it apart from that my laptop works well it has been doing everything it said it would i particularly like the keys and in the dark the back light
