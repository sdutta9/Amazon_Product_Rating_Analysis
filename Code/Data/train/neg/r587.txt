typically i have went overkill on pcs and laptops this time i tried to better target my non gaming usage you won t find another 1080p laptop in this price range and the i3 processor feels more than adequate the hard drive would be the weak link with the system i went ahead and ordered a new 250gb ssd from crucial ct7756614 and followed the youtube video for replacement the trickiest part is popping the keyboard cover off without pulling the cables out just be slow and patient and you shouldn t have an issue after the hard drive is swapped simply insert a bootable windows 10 disk or flash drive that you create from microsoft and you are set no windows 10 key is needed nor is asked for it is coded into the motherboard the memory upgrade is painless and you can add up to another 8gb the memory upgrade isn t as revolutionary as the ssd drive but i went ahead and did this because it was not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not cost prohibitive the end result is a 1080p laptop with a 250gb ssd and 12gb of memory in the 500 price range really tough to beat
