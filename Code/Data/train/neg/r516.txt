i bought this as a replacement for my 4th generation ipad which was running out of space i am returning it tomorrow and going back to my ipad a couple of caveats for this review 1 i ve only had the surface 3 for two days 2 my sole purpose for the surface 3 was for reading and marking up pdf textbooks and lecture powerpoints then syncing those markups to my mac i didn t try to explore many other features pros pen you have to pay 50 extra but the pen is amazing it senses pressure writes smooth lines just like on paper and have buttons that allow you to quickly erase or cut your notes when the pen is engaged touching the screen does nothing so you can t accidentally leave stray marks over everything the pen is the main reason i bought this device writing with my ipad s fat 10 stylus doesn t even come close size my ipad only has 16 gb of space this tablet comes with 64 gb plus room for more ports this thing has a usb port which was awesome and could have been so so useful unfortunately it refused to read or even format my exfat formatted flash drive desktop pc this is a blessing and a curse but it is pretty nifty to be able to run desktop applications from a little tablet screen size it s a little bigger than my ipad and the extra screen real estate is nice features there s some cool things you can do with this it s handwriting recognition is amazing there s even an option where you can use a stylus as a keyboard you can write the letters you want and the surface translates into text you can use this in search bars and even address bars pay attention apple negatives battery life running onenote adobe reader and edge i e internet explorer in tablet mode with a full charge the predicted battery life was just under 3 hours given that i m sometimes in lecture for much longer that s a deal breaker my 3 year old ipad chugs along for 8 hours with no problem screen quality the screen is bigger but fewer pixels and worse contrast it was a much less pleasent reading experience than on my ipad speed programs load quicly but actually using them can be slow for example i sent a 12mb pdf to onenote to read and highlight it took several minutes to upload and once it had it would only load one page at a time it look longer for it to load a page than for me to read that page not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not helpful when i tried to upload a 46mb pdf it took 30 minutes to import and then pages refused to load at all this takes seconds on my ipad with notability this was a dealbreaker i don t have days to spend uploading over a dozen textbooks onto this device i ve heard drawboard is much better about reading large pdf s but it won t sync to my desktop stability onenote kept crashing when i tried to import a 46mb textbook to it via the 34 send to onenote 34 feature it eventually made it through but i m used to my ipad which rarely crashes it also did a wierd thing where i would click on the adobe reader tile and onenote would open up i restarted it and it stopped doing that but onenote did lock a few times even when not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not uploading things i take fast notes on this thing during lectures it can t freeze on me syncing i have a mac and getting this to share information was hard you can run icloud on the surface but files show up very slowly probably apple s fault dropbox is a little faster onenote syncs small notes with the desktop app easily but doesn t sync large files at all os i do think it s nifty to run desktop applications on a tablet but the dual os system is just confusing it also really expects you to have a keyboard the onscreen keyboard does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not always pop up when you click on a text field if you are in desktop mode there s a little keyboard icon that you can click on to make the keyboard appear manually if you are in tablet mode and the keyboard doesn t pop up on its own often you have to manually turn off tablet mode and then click on the keyboard icon sound confusing yeah it is it s also difficult to get this thing to acknowledge a screen tap which makes opening programs or accessing menus a pain tl r this is definitely a compromise device it does some awesome things that an ipad just can t but it lacks the simplicity reliability and speed of an ipad it is more affordable and portable than a high end laptop but lacks the juice to run a desktop os easily it is also intended as a stand alone device which means most programs aren t designed to sync up with a desktop version this could be the perfect device for some people while being useless to others i would recommend buying this from somewhere with an excellent return policy and then putting it through it s paces right away the only way to know if it will work for you is to try it unless you want to read annotate and sync textbooks to a mac then it won t work get an ipad instead
