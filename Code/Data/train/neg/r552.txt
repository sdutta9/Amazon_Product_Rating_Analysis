even though i m still getting used to windows 10 which came installed it s taking some time to get used to the different menus i would have given it 5 stars but i was led to believe that office 365 came pre loaded not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not true it does if you are an organization or school but not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not for personal use which wasn t explained on the items description i had to purchase office 365 to get the pen to work properly then the pre loaded onenote wouldn t communicate with the onenote that came with the purchased office 365 i had to take it to geek squad to get that fixed default app settings didn t help it s working great now and i m extremely happy with the small portable size it fits right in my purse
