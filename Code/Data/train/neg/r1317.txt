the product is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not bad just slower than we wanted to be so we needed to uninstall a few program that we were not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not going to use and it worked better ran a lot faster and became tolerable the bummer with this purchase was having to pay shipping to receive it and if we want to retrun we have to pay for that too therefore we resolved the issues ourselves to create a better working product for our needs all in all it was a okay purchase
