200 bucks for a laptop like this i pretty satisfied the weight is a bit heavy for a girl but not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a big problem it runs very smoothly battery duration is good and it is quite during operation which i love most again this price is super nice for this laptop it is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not high end laptop but meet all basic needs if you have higher expectations then you probably have to look for a higher priced laptop
