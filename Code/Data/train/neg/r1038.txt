i am very happy with this laptop i ve had it for almost a month now and i use it every day i love the touchscreen it came with windows 8 1 and i have not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not upgraded to 10 yet but i m surprisingly happy with 8 i have at this point used many of the features and consider myself an intermediate to advanced computer user it was simple to set up and is simple to use and i haven t had any problems with any programs or setup it also comes happily clear of bloatware so there is little to delete or change upon setup the processing speed is perfect for what i need i use this laptop primarily for typing documents as i have a transcription business the keyboard is smooth i feel the mouse pad is well placed and well designed i have no complaints with any of this and this laptop replaces a fairly new acer whose keyboard i hate it does a great job for the price my one fairly large criticism is the optical drive which is something i require in my business in reading i have done it appears some lenovos have an issue burning a blank disk this is clearly one of them you can t do anything with a blank disk i ve tried different cds and dvrs from different manufacturers the drive is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not recognized at all if there is a blank disk in it and the laptop locks up so you have to reboot it you often can t eject the disk at all without doing it manually with a pin i ve spent hours trying to figure this issue out and following instructions i ve found on line for changing registry entries etc but nothing seems to work for me a disk that is formatted works flawlessly i will end up calling technical support as it s clearly under warranty but i didn t want to waste a bunch more time on the phone just yet if i could figure it out myself i have other laptops i can use for burning disks but that is a pain overall i rate this laptop 4 stars and if the disk issue can be fixed at this point i would give it 5
