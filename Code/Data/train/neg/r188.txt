unless just want to enjoy your music and read documents not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not all kindle books and watch video files do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not purchase this unless you plan to just try it out and then return it for a full refund right now the best thing about the surface 2 that i have is that it has a nice large screen for reading articles and watching videos pros came installed with office and this appears to work as expectednice large screenusb input allows you to easily access stored files note that none of these above 34 pros 34 are unavailable in other tablets in other words there s nothing unique here yet power seems to last well but it could be because i do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not use it very often the cons kindle for windows 8 does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not allow you to send personal documents if someone has found a way to do this i would give this review another star kindle for windows 8 does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not open all books what if you re expected to replace your tablet with a surface what happens to the books you suddenly cannot open are you expected to just read them on a pc how is that innovative c mon microsoft i am one of your biggest flagwavers i hate apple for their drm but you keep regressing with every other os cannot install most software that can be downloaded and run on a pc not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not even a windows 8 pc so why is microsoft calling this a pc again if someone has a way to do this i will most definitely add a star there is no way to kill an app that appears to be stuck this is an important feature that can be available in most android tablets either with a built in feature or from a free app in the play store so you are forced to shutdown and then restart notice i said 34 shut down 34 first there is no option to reboot which all pcs have so i ask again why is microsoft calling this a pc bing sorry but even google tablets don t flaunt google so much this does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not endear me to bing just makes me loathe it more and i know it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a real con not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not til you try the maps anyway which makes you long for google maps compels you to sync your skype account with a microsoft account what is that about i do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not like coercion in any way shape or form do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not try to tell me this is good for me i was doing just fine logging into skype the old fashioned way there is no 34 one step back 34 button if it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not available in the app you have only the option to go to 34 home 34 again this is a feature most android tablets have apparently you can install updates for only the app you want to install updates for but you have to click to update all then select the ones you don t want to update because it will take that much longer to get the one you really want updated and click 34 cancel update 34 on those i can probably find more cons but mostly i have a general dislike for microsoft building this thing and calling it a pc and a tablet when every time i try to do something that was previously easy on a pc or a tablet i find some new thing to dislike so great job microsoft if you were trying to alienate your fans in a new way and chase them over to apple or android
