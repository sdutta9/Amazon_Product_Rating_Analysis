the dell d630 s were made in 2007 and 2008 and are a nice sturdy and rugged laptop not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not like some of the all plastic ones so it weights a bit more and the technology is 5 6 years old it s also had 5 6 years of prior use i need a sturdy laptop for some stuff i do so i gave this a shot i also needed it right away i bought this from red tag on amazon and he sent me a good laptop and i ve had only a couple small problems like the windows office included was only a trial version not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not what i wanted i paid extra for that a 2 extra mb of ram the ram is fine i left 5 stars because it s a nice clean unit and works well pre sale communication was good but post sale was erratic red tag has 100 positive feedback the big thing you have to consider when buying a refurb is price vs value to you sure the refurbs are cheaper but not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not that much cheaper when you consider that for an extra hundred you can get a brand new laptop never before used with a 1 year warranty after looking i see many of the refurbs are way overpriced and i should have bought a new one with new technology that hundred bucks i may have saved may come back to bite me any problems and one little repair will be over 100 so you may want to shop around before you buy a refurb there are better refurb prices too out there i discovered later next time i ll buy a new laptop just for the newer technology warranty and no prior use some of these refurbs and used are way too expensive look around the internet first prices have really dropped on new laptops too and these refurbs should drop too i ve used mine everyday for nearly 3 months and so far it s fine for now
