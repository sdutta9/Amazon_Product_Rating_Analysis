i won t get into the technical stuff here i will just point out some things that a normal person can relate to when comparing a tablet if your a tech buff then read the other reviews i wanted something portable so my wife can produce word documents and excel spread sheets and for my kids to create power point presentations for school i wanted to get the pro 2 but it was more than i wanted to spend and the surface 2 had all the office software that we needed and i had a netbook that has the full windows 7 installed that is still portable enough that one can still take with them if they needed a full computer i figure for the price difference between the surface 2 and pro 2 i can use that towards another newer portable netbook still got to have a full featured computer a two for one if you will in case you didn t know you cannot install software on the surface 2 the pro 2 you can if you want a computer replacement although the surface 2 should have the software that most average people would need but a good old fashioned computer is still better than any tablet for major work because they are still more powerful and a lot of ports for different plug ins get a fully loaded 11 inch laptop if you want portability so know what you are looking for don t believe all the reviews out there saying the ipad air is the better tablet those reviews are biased and only bring up the minor upgrades from the old ipad and base the comparisons off of those few things and the only two really bad things they had to say about the ipad air was that it didn t have a fingerprint scanner and it didn t come in gold the 80 s called and they want their gaudy flashy gold bling back most of these reviews will only focus on those points and will not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not mention all the other advantages the surface 2 has and for the few reviews that do mention the other features the surface 2 has they still favor the ipad because the camera was nicer or more apps really i am using the ipad air as comparison as it seems to be the standard what the reviews usually leave out or down play surface 21 full office software word excel powerpoint onenote 2 wide screen optimized for wide screen movies when held in portrait when you are surfing the web for example you get a a longer list so you don t scroll as much 3 micro sd slot easy to download or upload data on the fly 4 3 0 usb so you can easily backup files to a hard drive and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not have all your eggs in one basket or transfer files with anything that has a usb plug and also charge your phone ipad no unless you have the adapter and you can t charge your phone 5 can print to almost every printer 6 hdmi port7 flash support so you are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not limited browsing the web 8 built in two position kickstand 9 thin keyboards that double as covers can get them background lit flat with real keys and a new one coming out withbuilt in battery to recharge your surface at the same time on a charge battery in tablet is good already though some say that you need to buy a keyboard to make full use of the surface and adds to the cost ridiculous you do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not it will make life more easier though if you are working on a spreadsheet or word document with an ipad you don t need one because what use would it be for sure there are apps but they are limited to what you can create or edit you have to do major creating and editing on a computer first and then hook up the ipad and transfer it 10 hook up to your t v or another monitor and drag an open window to the second screen 11 do a split screen on the tablet 12 run multiple tasks at the same time in the background like listening to music watching a video and doing somethingelse like typing an email or working on an a office document in split screen mode 13 wirelessly sync with your xbox and play games on your t v stream videos pictures etc 14 drag and drop files 15 can set up individual separate users on the tablet and have parental monitoring updates and deciding what child can do on the tablet unlike the ipad i can be in the middle of something and then let others use the surface with their own logins and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not interrupt my session when i come back to it later everyone can be working on their own word document for example and don t have to have the other person log out of an app so someone else can use it and each person has their own private log in to protect their work now these are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not all the surface 2 offers i am finding new things still the ipad air is basically the same ipad as before with minor tweaks it s faster and lighter still does the same thing as before nothing new ipad air1 powerful processor for doing nothing new future fingerprint scanner tablet will still only run apps as before 2 lighter and thinner is negated by the cases to protect the ipad and without a keyboard 3 upgraded camera put it down your annoying the people behind your trying to see the wedding or play use a real camera 4 no usb or sd slot need adapters for just about everything and with the surface 2 you can plug the unit in when it is dead and keep on using it and still do things via the sd card or usb cables on an ipad you can t do both you either charge it or plug in an adapter to the only port the ipad has do to something and if it is dead you have to wait until you charge it first also you need to bring all the adapters and keyboard with you vs the surface 2 of which all you need is the power cable and the cover keyboard is so thin it is negligible in bulk and weight and justifying that the ipad has third party keyboards is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not valid it is a separate bulky keyboard and the ipad does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not support mouse functions you are stuck with third party hardware that is apple specific whereas with the surface you can use anything that supports micro sd or usb and having to buy all these accessories tofor the ipad will not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not be cheap people gripe about the suface cover keyboard costs too much well to buy a seperate cover for an ipad will cost 40 00 and it will flop around and a non intergrated keypad will cost 100 00 that you have to carry seperatley 5 having to convert simple files with apple software a hassle 5 tons of apps android not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not far behind and microsoft growing how much apps does one need 6 what good is the reina display if it isn t widescreen picture is actually smaller than 9 7 with the black bars 7 only compatible with apple products i e cant print unless it is an airprint printer or stream to t v unless apple t v 8 slightly upgraded camera put it away your blocking my view and people with a 4 8 inch phone look ridiculous at least they are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not carrying around the perfect sized iphone for one handed operation along with a 9 6 tablet that takes two hands kind of contradicting the ipad air has more negatives than positives so how can it be better android tablets have more features even than the ipads i guess if you want one just for games and apps then an ipad or a higher end android tablet might suit your needs people are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not weighing in that the surface 2 can do more than just play games now back to the surface 2 there was a slight learning curve to understand what all the gestures do it didn t take long though look it up on youtube and you will pick it up real quick along with a lot of tips and tricks of what it is capable of there different ways to open close move split screen multitask etc the tablet feels a little heavy in the hand if you had to hold it i admit but the two position kickstand works pretty good on the lap as i didn t think it would i don t have to have a cover to add to the bulk to double as a kickstand also and even if i put on one of the super thin keyboards they would add very little weight or bulk and they snap on and off without any hassle also keep in mind which keyboard would work better for you the keyboard without the real keys requires a little harder tap on them than with the one with real keys so if you do a lot of typing or use it on your lap you may want the one with real keys the boot up time takes a little while when completely off but remember it is opening real office programs when in sleep mode it opens up quickly i went several days at a time of casual use and in sleep mode without charging and it still had a charge the tiles are nice because it is real time data so i can glance at them without opening up an app for email weather etc on apple you have a bunch of icons and you have open it up android you can use widgets with a real browser and flash i can use full websites rather than a mobile version and also it is a lot easier to open multiple tabs when surfing the internet unlike some tablets where it is a pain to pop back and forth between tabs as i mentioned above it is nice to have the split screen because my kids can research on the web on one side and write their paper on the other side while listening to music of which they shouldn t be three cons i find on the surface 2 so far is that the power cord is only about 58 inches long you have to be really close to an outlet of some sort the second con was that the software and backup takes up about 16 gigs so you don t have the full gigs of memory stated so might have to get an sd card yes other tablets you only lose about 2 gigs but remember they are pretty much entertainment tablets only and can t do what the surface 2 can do and the third con was it gets hung up once in a while surfing the web the last two cons are why i deducted a star if you are waiting for a ipad air pro to come out don t be surprised if it doesn t come with a retina display finger print scanner nice camera etc you will have to wait for the pro s pro s1 etc to get one feature at a time and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not several at once i mean come on cant even throw in a simple camera flash the ipads shouldn t even be placed in the categories of tablets that can run office software there should be a category for dumb tablets that only run apps a category for smart tablets for those that can run fully functioning office software and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not just limited mobile versions and extreme tablets for ones that can run full blown office suites
