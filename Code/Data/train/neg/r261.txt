i ve had this for about a week now and it s very close to perfect the keyboard has a feel that is very close to a macbook which i like the touchpad is one of the weaknesses i am not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not sure if it s the texture of it but it s definitely not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not very sensitive to touch the touchscreen is fantastic looks great very responsive etc the overall build is very good too the positives are looks build quality touchscreen screen options tablet laptop tent etc negatives touchpad 1 memory dimm slot dell only supports up to 8gb the jury is still out for me on the hinge design it makes a bit of a creaking noise when i change it from tablet to laptop i cannot yet comment on how it holds up
