the reason i am giving this device such a low score in this review is based off one of the most simple concepts that i would think a reputable company would have mastered by now the charging mechanism cord plug does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not work after 3 short weeks of ownership the light does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not come on to indicate charger is plugged in nor does it charge the device what is the use of having a useful tablet on hand at all time anywhere if it will never ever charge microsoft is doing something about it but boy was it hard thing to get to get a new charger what if that isn t the prob then what aghh the screen has also become non responsive to touch at times weird huh this is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not what i imagined buying a microsoft product current ipad owner that charges all the time 3 years later plain disappointment sad face update microsoft has sent a new charging mechanism cord tablet is working perfectly charging perfectly yes so happy now so as my review for actual product is 5 stars the company i purchased it from was not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not as high scoring yes they were going to accept it back but i had to pay for a damaged product and never did that company suggest anything like the tech support of microsoft soo in conclusion buy this product directly thru microsoft unless you dont mind jumping thru hoops for a cheaper priced item
