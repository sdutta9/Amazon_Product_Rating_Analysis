this laptop looks brand new and i bought it used it works fabulously as well when i first got it i really had to charge it because it wouldn t turn on without the charger plugged in but that s it other than the fact that when i was tracking it it got shipped to the wrong shipping facility so it was a day late i was not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not happy about that but at least it wasn t delayed more so or i would have been upset but other than that it s a great product in great condition
