my xps13 constantly returns double characters for a single keyboard stroke it is useless for typing which is why i got a laptop instead of an ipad it s probably one of the worst devices i ve ever owned seriously look elsewhere if you need a functional keyboard i m off to update my bios drives etc what a grand adventure this is most likely the last dell i will own update upgrading to the latest 05 bios did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not resolve the problem but it may have helped a bit update omg this laptop keyboard sucks so bad kill me now
