this is a great value for the laptop i bought it for my 14 year old child and because his school required it it has plenty of space and thermos for school stuff i would not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not recommend this for a 34 gamer 34 since it s probably going to need more space you truly can t go wrong at the end of the day if he uses it for a couple of years i more than got my money s worth would work great for a small business portable too
