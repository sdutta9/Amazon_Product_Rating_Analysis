i wanted to love this laptop but i ended up taking it back to bestbuy and getting a refund it seems to run slower than it should be given the processor was a fifth generation i7 and had 8 gigs of ram ni could have lived with the speed of the computer but the wifi was unusable for me it would disconnect all the time and often times wouldn t even see any wifi networks yes i updated the wifi adapter drivers uninstalled them reinstalled them etc but nothing worked reading reviews i know i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not alone with this problem and i know windows 10 has issues with the wifi but i didn t want to spend the good money on this hoping it might be fixed someday i was also getting weird start up anomalies where the computer would go into repair mode and again it could be a w10 issue but i it didn t leave me feeling very secure about the product neverything else on it is very cool but too bad the issues weren t cleared up nthe tablet and touch screen were awesome
