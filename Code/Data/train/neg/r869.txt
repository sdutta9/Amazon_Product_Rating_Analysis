touchpad is terrible i have searched every possible solution and tried to talk to dell but no fixes are working i have changed my settings as suggested still not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not fixed i strongly urge you to re consider buying this machine most issues are intermittent which makes it more irritating for example trying to right or left click does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not work pointer moves unable to r click and copy trying to highlight a word is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not accurate the list goes on and on i have owned dell computers in the past but this problem is awful
