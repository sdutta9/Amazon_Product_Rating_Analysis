would have a 5 star review except for the fact it is falsely advertised as a 2 7 ghz processor when in fact it maxed at 2 2 it doesn t sound like a lot but say you pay for an item that costs 220 and you hand the cashier 300 but he only hands you 30 in change you would want that 50 he shorted you wouldn t you the processor can be over clocked to meet the advertised speed but it is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not sold as over clocked
