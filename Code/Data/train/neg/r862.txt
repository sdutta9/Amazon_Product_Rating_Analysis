overall i like this laptop it s a beautiful laptop quite sturdy i am a bit upset that there is no disc drive so now i will need to buy a usb disc reader i have had some problems with the keypad so far it gets stuck or lags i haven t figured out if it is due to me being unfamiliar with it of if it is really an issue with the laptop itself it s pretty speedy but not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not necessarily the fastest it runs about as well if only slightly better as my old sony laptop did which was almost six years old i will only use the laptop for school and the occasional media i wouldn t use or recommend it for gaming however i definitely feel the price is perhaps a bit much for what you get but oh well
