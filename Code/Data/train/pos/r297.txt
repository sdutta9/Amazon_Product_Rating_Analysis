purchased this unit to replace an old toshiba thus far extremely satisfied the first thing you ll notice is that the hardware is a bit dense as in it s heavier than it looks of course it looks like it should weigh about 3 pounds graphics and overall speed are right where you d expect with a zippy processor and excellent 2d performance both in normal computing and video playback games are iffy it s a low power onboard chipset final fantasy 13 lagged a bit but anything lower spec than that runs fine as a tablet it is bulky but powerful when watching movies use it in 34 tent 34 mode rather than resting the tablet on your legs as a portable workstation it s great the keyboard is sized well and the screen is clear and vivid one issue and it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a ding against the unit because it s stated plainly in the specs is the hard drive that thing is slow 5200rpm i believe upgrade to an ssd if you re impatient like me after slotting an ssd and spending some time with clonezilla resume from hibernation is on the order of 3 seconds and cold boot takes about 7 seconds the addition of an ssd also noticeably improved battery life speaking of batteries a good power policy and an ssd will net you about 5 6 hours of actual use which is pretty good for an i7 under heavy use expect something around 2 3 5 hours charge time is nothing special which is to say it s way better than my old massive gaming laptop 12 pounds most of it battery as to the inevitable drawbacks the speakers are placed toward the back near the screen and are tiny and tinny no bass response at all bring your headphones for entertainment usage maximum volume is about on par with a cell phone when in tablet mode you will inevitably and often hit the small start menu button under the screen which interrupts movies and several full screen apps the charge cable also seems to fall out with no provocation at all i swear i ve left it charging overnight and woke up to find the plug halfway out of its port a big complaint for me and something the industry needs to move away from is the ram soldered onto the mainboard this isn t a cell phone game console or tablet let us upgrade our ram 8gb is plenty now but i and many others tend to hold onto our devices for years and a little room to expand does factor into my buying decisions overall though it s the best 2 in 1 in its price range windows 10 updated review after installing windows 10 the inspiron 13 700 actually got better it s easier to switch in and out of tablet mode and the interface is a lot cleaner and better optimized for touch the screen smoothing got a little blurrier imo but that can be changed in settings battery life and performance remain mostly consistent and boot times seem to have gotten shorter i did have some problems with the initial upgrade install the screen rotation stopped working and a lot of drivers and features were missing when i performed a clean install everything worked out of the box including rotation and tablet mode switching when opening and closing the keyboard if you liked the software that came preloaded on 8 1 it will be gone with a clean install so beware i personally hate bloatware but honestly 10 seems tailor made for a 2 in 1 it leans more toward a traditional desktop ui than 8 1 but retains all the tablet features at the same time and you can easily switch between them one big complaint is that in many programs notably firefox the onscreen keyboard doesn t seem to know when to pop up and there s no charm or shortcut to easily access it in tablet mode i imagine this is down to a different api being used for keyboard input in some cases but it s pretty annoying as windows 8 1 had the same problem it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a point against 10 in the strictest sense but definitely is against microsoft mozilla
