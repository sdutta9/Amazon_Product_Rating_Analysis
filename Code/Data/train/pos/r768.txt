in the package we have laptop computer power adapter quick start and warranty instructions this laptop happens to have a touchscreen which i wasn t aware off when i purchased it i believe it isn t mentioned anywhere on amazon s product page to this date it isn t a deal breaker though but it can get annoying when windows provide tips on screen that require you to touch it to get it off it will also hold onto fingerprints as it has a glossy finish the screen also looks out of place on this machine at times as it appears to have a frame within the screen instead of the screen filling out the space up to the bezel this machine has an aluminum top which is a lot better than the flimsy plastic backing that is found on the lower end dell 300 series the drawback however is that the machine is slightly heavier than the 300 series keyboard is backlit but the keys are a bit small and don t have a lot of travel to them it feels flimsy at times touch pad will require some patience as well as some learning as to the gestures for inputs speakers aren t great but they sound good enough they quickly distort at high volumes or when they attempt to reproduce heavy bass though the webcam works ok haven t yet tested the mic this machine does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not have an optical disc drive battery life is around 4 5 hrs while surfing and watching the occasional youtube video this i believe is made possible by the use of intel s new broadwell core i5 5200u processor if there is one major drawback to this machine it is windows 8 what was microsoft thinking when they designed this if you are coming from windows 7 or xp it s going to take a lot of getting used to imagine i had to install a third party app to get something akin to a proper start button it also wants to link all your accounts together e mail login pictures etc it is a headache i am patiently waiting for the release of windows 10 but i am hoping that they release it sooner rather than later i like the machine thus far and it s a decent machine for the money it should get better with windows 10 will update if anything comes up
