i chose this over any other tablet or laptop because i needed it to function for school and still be able to read while on the treadmill so it needed a keyboard to be removable i ve only had it a weekend but i am already in love with this device prior to this i had a google nexus 10 which was annoyingly buggy and glitch i have no such complaints with this so far i absolutely love that it comes with real microsoft office and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the web based limited version bottom line if you need a laptop and a tablet this will work well for you my only suggestion is that if you intend to install a lot of applications or maintain a lot of data plan to buy the largest sd card possible at the same time or just opt for the larger size though dollar for dollar its cheaper to expand through sd card
