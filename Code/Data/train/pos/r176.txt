bashing microsoft and the windows rt tablet seems to be a popular theme on the web what a mistake to take them seriously i ve had my surface 2 just a few days and it s a great great machine setup was amazingly simple just enter my hotmail account info and everything else was done for me using skydrive with my win 8 desktop is seamless the surface 2 even found my hp wireless printer and configured it for use the display on the s2 is brilliant high rez easy to read brilliant colors the type cover took getting used to since it s small but now it s second nature the ability to have two windows open simultaneously is a real plus sorry ipad users you can t do that surface 2 is fast and easy to use i ve used it watch netflix videos and then using an optional cable connect it to a wall mounted hdtv that doesn t have internet built in having office on the surface and it s free is a real genuine plus i don t play games so i couldn t care less about candy crush or whatever it is i do use i heart radio and it works just fine microsoft has a real winner here i just hope they continue to support it and that people realize that there s more to a tablet than ios or android my hope is that microsoft realizes how cool this device is and port over microsoft mathematics and small basic to it the educational possibilities are endless
