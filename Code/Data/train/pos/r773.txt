honestly love this laptop the keyboard is super comfortable the touchpad is accurate the touch screen is super effective the overall speed and comfort is beyond satisfactory the backlit keyboard is so cool its a bit heavy but is a good replacement for your desktop and is simply a beauty in design but why a two stars well this computer broke down three times since the second month of owning it dell finally fixed it well enough but i m always on the edge that it will break again and that i will have to keep sending it back to dell i m worried it ll break again after my warranty ends and after that it s going to be a waste don t buy this laptop especially from any amazon carrier dell inspiron simply isn t worthy the hassle it has given me since summer maybe i got unlucky but i would n t risk it either dell is infamous for their dud products and their terrible long customer service they wouldn t even place the product sigh 2 star for breaking product 5 star for the laptop itself
