i purchased this laptop to give myself something to tinker with while recovering from surgery the system has been working perfectly for the last 2 months and is probably the best bang for the buck for a laptop refurb the versitility of this machine allows for a second battery or hard drive to be installed in the module bay i purchased a used docking station which also includes a bay where the battery can be charged or the hd or dvd rom module can be used it is always a roll of the dice when you buy refurbed or used computers and parts and sometimes you will get a defective unit but i am very happy with this purchase
