i purchased this tablet b c i was frustrated with the way apple products i owned controlled me and my files surface works on everything that frustrated me about the apple products i owned ipad iphones etc for example i have more freedom in saving files emailing files viewing files plugging in various usb devices and using the tablet for work play at first windows 8 is intimidating because it is new however it was easy to learn and isn t much different than previous versions of windows if you prefer the desktop view over tiles i also purchased the type cover 2 keyboard it works extremely well and i have had no issues yet
