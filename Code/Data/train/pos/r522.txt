i have been looking for a light weight laptop computer for traveling this is the lightest among the ones i looked at with the keyboard it is only 1 lb 14 5 ounces yet it is a full functioning windows computer i do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not play games nor do i edit videos a lot especially during traveling i use my iphone with bose noise cancelling headphone to listen to music i just need to send and receive emails book tickets pay bills surf the internet etc so this atom processor meets my need perfectly with good battery life it is quiet as well like my ipad mini i really like this new laptop tablet
