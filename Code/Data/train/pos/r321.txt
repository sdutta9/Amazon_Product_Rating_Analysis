this tablet is the best value you can get for the price i ll be honest i hate apple and all things related to it i can also say that this tablet definitely blows the ipad out of the water with the features and specs i ve been using it for a week now and have watched a movie played a couple apps for hours surfed the internet for a day and also read some e books and only had to charge it once if your thinking about getting it just do it you will be happy you did bottom line it boots up quickly very responsive doesn t freeze or lock up while multi tasking and will do what your expecting it to do
