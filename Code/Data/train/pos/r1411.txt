when my laptop arrived i was very anxious and decided to open the box and begin working on my new laptop surprisingly after it rebooted the blue screen popped out stating that windows has shut down program and should wait until it reboots itself or a program needs to be re installed moreover this is a bad precident the seller exhibited without checking out the product before sale
