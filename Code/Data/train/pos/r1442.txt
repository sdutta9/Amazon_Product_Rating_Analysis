after having to return the first machine because it locked up withing the first two hours of operation i received my second machine it works fine but the battery life is less than 30 minutes so as long as i have it plugged into the wall it is a good machine the only negative is the battery life being so short but there was a statement in the bio of the laptop that gave no guarantee for the battery life
