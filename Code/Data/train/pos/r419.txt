i got this recently as a replacement for my laptop my laptop was actually working fine but it was bulky and heavy i wanted something lightweight that had the ability to act as a regular windows computer i was going to get the surface pro 3 but then i decided to wait a few months for the surface pro 4 i m glad i did i actually really love this computer despite the hiccups at launch i got mine on the day it was released i haven t been this excited about a new piece of tech since i got my very first iphone almost 10 years ago to be honest the surface is what i wish the ipad had been a powerful computer that would lighten the load on my backpack when i m traveling however the ipad was extremely hard to be productive on and it ended up sitting on my shelf collecting dust after a few initial bugs which have mostly been ironed out by microsoft i m happy to say that the surface is extremely fun to use fast and has all the flexibility that a normal pc has the display is simply beautiful the contrast color and clarity of the screen is amazing it s quite the luxury after my washed out laptop screen the pen is a nice accessory although i will be honest that i haven t found much use for it beyond doing the new york times crossword puzzle which is actually strangely satisfying when using the pen they keyboard cover is lightweight enough to not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not add too much to the tablet and the feel is great for quick typists like myself i will say that the surface is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not without some lingering bugs i have faith that microsoft will get these sorted but they aren t deal breakers by any means at least for myself the worst is that sometimes the computer doesn t go into or out of sleep mode properly however until that s fixed i will just shut down the computer when leaving it for long periods of time it really only takes a few seconds longer the only other thing is battery life it knocks the pants off my old laptop s measly 1 5 hours of battery life however it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not quite the 9 hours or so that was advertised it s more like 5 6 hours of real world usage overall if you re looking for something lightweight that has the power and flexibility of a full windows rig look no further
