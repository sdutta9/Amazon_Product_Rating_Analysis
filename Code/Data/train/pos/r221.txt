with the surface 2 you kind of need to know what you are getting into surface 2 doesn t use the normal version of windows 8 1 it uses windows 8 1 rt this is a watered down version of the full blown os that will only run on arm and similar based processors not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the standard intel processors in the surface pro and pro 2 this means you can not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not run standard windows software on the surface or surface 2 this can only be done on the surface pro or pro 2 so then what are you buying you are buying a tablet that can only run software from the windows store this means that none of the standard windows programs will work and you had better make sure the apps you are looking for are available prior to buying the surface 2 i recommend going through and listing all the things you want to be able to do then check the apps for windows website to ensure you can do what you want the surface 2 comes with the ability to run internet explorer 11 and send receive email with the built in mail app that s 2 of the things most people want from a tablet right there and there is something new to windows rt 8 1 you now get outlook the full featured version not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not just the mail app included for free this is a bonus as not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not all business based email systems wanted to work well with the mail app something else that is included so in theory a 220 value added to the surface is office 2013 home and business this means that you get word excel power point and the above mentioned outlook pre installed and free if you want to use this device for business and need full office capability functionality and compatibility this is probably one of the best ways to get it in a tablet form it s important to note that office programs still aren t touch first programs so you probably want to invest in a type cover for the surface though in a pinch the touch keyboard and any of the office apps run really well on this device i really love the surface 2 i actually think that windows rt 8 1 when you know what you are getting into can be a viable alternative to an ipad sort of right there are still some native apps you would expect to find in the windows app store that just don t exist but since you can use the web browser and it is fully functional this isn t a massive issue pinning a website to the start screen where all the tiles are is pretty simple so you can make your own apps ghetto style with the pin capability and everything i ve done this way including instagram works quite well in terms of performance the office programs are probably the most demanding pieces of software on the surface 2 and they all open fairly quickly and input is quick and responsive i also played the halo spartan assault game and that runs well also not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not quite as fluid and flawless as my surface pro but it works really well regardless the screen is bright crisp and clean it s a 1080p screen so it s 1920x1080 resolution i would have rather seen 1920x1200 as this makes excel files easier to use and is more the business 16x10 aspect ratio but regardless even in 16x9 everything just looks fantastic and is easy to read battery life is very good i can squeeze out about 9 5 hours if i m just browsing the internet and messing in office the least i ve gotten is about 7 5 hours and the most was around 10 5 hours overall if you are on the market for a tablet and it doesn t need to be an ios based tablet i recommend giving the surface 2 a serious look just remember you can t run standard windows programs no different than an ipad or android tablet and you will do well if you want full windows capability the surface pro and pro 2 are great devices you just pay quite a bit more for that capability with less battery life
