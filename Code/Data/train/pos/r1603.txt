i was curious to try this out because i already own another dell laptop dell inspiron 15 i15rv 6144blk 15 6 inch touchscreen laptop black matte with textured finish i was curious to see how this dell inspiron i3541 2001blk 15 6 inch laptop would compare i also own a mac laptop which also factored into my comparisons from my experience so far it seems to fill a similar role as my existing dell laptop overall it doesn t have some of the bells and whistles of the apple which is to be expected based on the substantial price difference but like my other dell laptop it is a solid laptop for someone on a budget and functionally is sufficient for most of what the average user will need a laptop for aesthetics overall i liked the black and thought the textured finish was an interesting touch it does give the laptop a distinctive look but it s a little more subtle than the textured finish on my other dell which i appreciated the plastic case also seems sturdy and like it will be able to stand up to wear and tear however it doesn t necessarily have a luxurious look to it like you get with an apple personally i prefer the look of the metal on the macbook pros although it can get easily dented again however this is a tradeoff based on the price and was something i expected that said i do appreciate that it seems to be thinner than the other dell performance overall i have found the speed of this computer to be good i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not sure why my experience seems to be so different in this area than the reviewers who came before me i d say maybe my expectations are low but for my basic purposes surfing the web word processing and light gaming i don t notice a difference vs my other dell or my mac it doesn t generally get hung up even when i have multiple programs open which is a plus it also works well when gaming i ve been playing the sims 3 with expansion packs on this and haven t had any issues with the game crashing or lagging functionality overall i find the functionality of the computer to be good with my first dell the windows interface initially took some getting used to since i have almost exclusively been a mac user for a few years i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not sure everything is laid out in the most intuitive manner but do enjoy the home screen however after having that computer for almost a year it does become increasingly easier to get the hang of especially when i played around with the mouse settings since some of the side swiping motions were tripping me up i still prefer the mac interface over this but haven t found it to be prohibitively difficult to use this dell also seemed to give instructions about how to do different things in windows 8 when i was first using it which was very welcome i don t remember the same tutorials automatically popping up with the other dell but it does seem to make it easier to get acclimated it is important to note that this computer doesn t come with much of any preloaded software so unless you will use this only for web browsing you ll need to plan to purchase other software and should factor that cost in on top of the purchase price of the laptop thankfully if price is an issue there are increasingly a lot of great freeware programs available on the internet that offer similar functionality to more expensive programs like office or photoshop i also love that this computer makes it easy to connect to other devices the of usb ports has been sufficient for my use overall i think this laptop is a great value for the money and good for everyday computing needs i ve been happy with it i agree with the previous users that it is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not jam packed with features but i also didn t really expect it to be at this price point
