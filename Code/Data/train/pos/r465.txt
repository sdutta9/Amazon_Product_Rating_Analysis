i don t write as many reviews as i should especially considering how often i rely on them however i think it s important for anyone considering this laptop to know a few things 1 the included wireless network adapter card intel dual band ac 3160 gets sub par reception i wondered why i would get intermittent 34 error 34 messages when trying to connect to webpages it seemed to drop connections especially since i d use my smartphone in the same location and get consistent connections and much quicker downloads after getting fed up with it i downloaded a network monitor program to help me troubleshoot what was going on it seemed the reception i was getting from the router was very poor and when i picked it up off the desk it would immediately improve the closer i got to the router the better the signal to be expected but it was troubling to think it was getting terrible reception until i picked it up 3 34 above the desk i then put the same program on my old toshiba and sat it right next to it on the desk and my old laptop got consistently better reception with no dropouts i might add just like my smartphone no matter where i moved them my old toshiba got better more consistent reception after doing a lot of research it seems there are a lot of issues with this wireless adapter many of which were reported in this computer i suspect many people don t notice or report simply because their connections are stronger than mine but i promise you if you dig into this you ll see many comments about the poor reception and other related issues with this wireless adapter therefore unless your close to your router you might experience frustration 2 the trackpad design is terrible with no tactile division between right and left click you ll commonly click the one you don t want maybe it s that i cam from a laptop toshiba satellite a50 that had separate buttons for each but i can t get used to this and it pretty much forces you to use an external mouse which is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a convenient option when using it on your lap 3 the laptop is difficult to open this may seem like a small quibble but i ve had laptops that developed cracks in the hinge casing after years of opening up so i tend to be ginger when opening the computer since the hinge tension is so tight i find myself struggling to find anything to grasp on to when opening i frequently hear creaks in the housing when opening and it just worries me that it ll have issues down the road 4 the keyboard frequently fails to register keystrokes again another issue you ll find more about if you research you can never tell if it s a function of the keyboard or it s just because it s different than the last keyboard you used but it is problematic for me i m glad i waited after an extended period 4 months to learn before writing this review because my initial review would have been quite good it s an attractive laptop at a good price from a name you would think you could trust hopefully understanding my experience will help some of you to notice these things before your return period is over so you don t have to go through dell warranty support and be without a computer while it s being fixed good luck
