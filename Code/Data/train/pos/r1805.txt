work has forced me to switch from mac to pc i don t have any bias against pc have always just preferred the mac platform for my needs i bought this to replace a 7 year old macbook i expected the processing speeds to be faster or at minimum the same as my overloaded well used macbook this thing is much slower the track pad is unresponsive and irritating to use the screen hinge is way tight opening and adjusting the screen angle is a two hand chore i was excited to have a new windows platform but im left disappointed
