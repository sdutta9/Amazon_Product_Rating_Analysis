well i bought a dell inspiron as my first laptop back in the day and found it to be great but pretty huge my second laptop was a sony vaio which was just about the same cost as this dell inspiration 13 700 series with a slightly smaller screen but was heavier if i compare it to that one i would still say that was better as it had a blu ray drive and a harddrive that was bigger but sadly still the same mechanical one that is the conventional harddrive and it had much less ram coming in at 4gb i use laptops for media and business stuff so for media that vaio was great i bought lots of discs and used it to view them coming from that perspective i was afraid that having a laptop that ditches a disc drive wouldnt be so good but after experiencing that with a chromebook i bought reletively recently i found i could manage i enjoyed my time with this laptop from dell it is much sleeker design than most bulkier laptops from the past few years and especially from the inspiron line through the years i wonder if they brought in a more modern designer though sadly the designer seems to have wanted to add a pretty wide margin of space from the edge of the view able screen to the rest of the top portion of the laptop the laptops screen is hd resolution and is fantastic for watching video flipping it over enables it to be used as a tablet which provides a very immersive experience for video viewing even more so the sound comes from the side of the laptop which means nothing is distorted while listening however i prefer connecting to a bluetooth enabled speaker or using headphones instead yes it has bluetooth im just really impressed with the video viewing capabilities of this and it does hd bd quality video files well too im pleased with the ram and processor too it is able to handle tons of tabs by tons i mean 20 on chrome without giving me messages or giving me tons of slowdown which other computers do do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not get anything in 2gb ram sizing as its just too restricting only thing this computer cant do is most modern videogames the fan that is usually whisper quite gets pretty loud and thus the chassis heats up fast apart from non visually taxing things like hearthstone or visual novels i really wouldnt spend time on trying to buy and get the latest games like the newest sims or the witcher 3 on this sorry and who would want to play those in low settings so all in all this is a fantastic laptop for the video viewing capabilities its on the lighter side it has lots of ram and is whisper quite for general use and video watching design wise it looks sleek and fresh it is perhaps one of the better laptops from dell in years its also windows 10 ready and doesnt come with bloatware and other excessive things it runs vlc well for videos and chrome works wonderfully too minor advice probably invest in a wireless keyboard and wireless mouse the keypad and keys arent that comfortable its minor and nothing i would ding the whole computer for but these days it seems all designers across the board have failed to innovate and explore better user input methods on keyboards only benefit is the backlighting though the touchscreen is a nice cosmetic touch for control but you wouldnt really want to be touching and smearing the screen that much especially since its kind of reflective in some light settings meanwhile from my experience excessive reliance of the touchpad on laptops leads to wear and tear and it looks ugly when they use these gray ones and you can start seeing discolorization after awhile it also requires on this laptop quite a bit of pressure to click and finally the battery life could be a bit better coming out with around 5 and half hours is kind of low for a laptop in summer 2015 definitely keep the power cord handy it will be interest to see how much charge the battery retains after one year of use will update to see if it still gets that much
