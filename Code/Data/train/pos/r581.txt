sofar it worked fine for me i design microprocessors for living so know a thing or two about how they should perform for 350 the construction feel is excellent the cpu is fantastic i haven t explored windows 10 fully so cant make any comment on it even with flash running in all windows it is surprisingly cool unlike the apple laptop which blasts the fan like a tornado and the laptop becomes a personal heater some thing apple needs to address the only complaint is the macaffe antivirus which some times just hogs the cpu resources which again intel should address as they own it now
