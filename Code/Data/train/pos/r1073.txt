the laptop was delivered ahead of schedule which is always a plus mostly everything about this computer is great love the keyboard for some reason the computer is fast after you get rid of all the useless and some times duplicates files the tack pad is a negative as it tends to not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not function properly using a mouse counter this problem well the graphics aren t amazing but still pretty good overall great product
