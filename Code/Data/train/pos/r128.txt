i really wanted to like the surface 2 after all what is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not to like about a tablet that can run all those nice microsoft office programs has a nice screen and weighs about 1 5 lbs well i found some usability issues 1 first this machine is rather slow when doing web browsing pages that take 3 4 seconds to load on the ipad or on a windows laptop take about 8 seconds to load on the surface 2 tap a link and it appears nothing is happening then finally if you haven t gotten impatient and tapped the link again the browser finally renders the page it works it is adequate but if you are use to any modern computer or competing tablet it is just slow 2 some pages don t render properly on the surface 2 this can happen on any computer but i found that on the surface 2 it happens quite often go to an amazon page and you find that the picture of a product obscures the first 3 or 4 letters of the text all the way down the page no way to get around it 3 when using an ipad whenever you tap into a box which requires typing text the keyboard automatically appears hit enter and the keyboard will politely disappear but on the surface 2 you have to tap on the keyboard icon to call it up apparently the operating system is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not bright enough to figure out you want to type when you place the cursor into a text box when you hit enter it lingers on and you have to hit the x to make it disappear okay you can live with this but here is where it gets bad the keyboard will actually hide the box you are trying to type into so you are forever trying to move boxes around to avoid the keyboard very messy and unimpressive 4 on the surface 2 it seems that sometimes the operating system forgets that you are using your fingers to tape a link or menu so quite often you find you have actually tapped a neighboring menu very frustrating the ios system is designed to totally minimize this sort of thing 5 then there is the occasional erratic behavior tap on a folder in favorite and ie tries to open all 12 bookmarks in the folder this jams the surface and it becomes unusable 6 since this just runs rt and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not standard windows 8 1 why does it insist on having two versions of ie 2 versions of onenote and 2 versions of word one is in metro tileworld and the other is on the desktop open one and it has no idea what you ve done in the companion twin program for instance set up a bookmark in desktop ie and metro ie has no idea you did that for whatever reason the system set up 2 different tiles for onenote the first is in perfect sync with desktop onenote but the second tile acts as thought it is on a totally different computer and has no idea what you did in desktop onenote this system often seems schizophrenic desktop makes sense in standard windows you can run dozens or hundreds of windows programs from desktop but in rt windows 8 1 desktope is so limited with so few programs that work in it you wonder why they didn t just go with tileworld 7 the 129 keyboard seems rather flimsy looks like it would tear apart after a few months use i give the surface 2 3 stars because for some tasks it works okay and it does run office a big plus but many things including basic web browsing experience need improving i think most people who want to run on a windows type platform would be better off with a small windows laptop or if you really want a tablet i d get the ipad air one more thing i should add about microsoft s return procedures i made the mistake of purchasing the surface 2 directly from microsoft s online site when it came to returning it the procedure was something out of the paleozoic age you are directed to an outsourced staff in the phillipines who are given very cumbersome procedures it takes about 30 minutes on the phone then you have to wait a few days for a shipping label and they say about 2 weeks for a refund i told them they should take a look at amazon where returns and shipping labels take 1 minute and refunds are nearly instantaneous i like other microsoft products onenote is superb but i would never think of ever buying from their online store again
