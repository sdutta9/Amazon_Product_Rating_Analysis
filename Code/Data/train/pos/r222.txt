i didn 8217 t need a new computer i have a lenovo t420 and that i really like but i wanted something more portable to have around the house and to travel with i originally purchased a discounted surface pro 1 at the microsoft store i was convinced i needed the pro even though i had a good friend who said i didn 8217 t based upon my needs i brought it home and instantly fell in love 8230 except for the price weight and battery life at the end of the day it was super powerful but not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not what i had in mind for something to carry around the house that would also work with the dod cac card websites i took it back and purchased a surface 2 64 gig with a bundle that got me the type cover 2 touch cover 1 25 microsoft store card microsoft complete care and tablet sleeve if you do your research you know the specs of the machine pros 2 position kick stand is much better than the version 1 great screen comes with an office suite that actually works ie 11 is a browser with few limitations compared to ios and android you don 8217 t need stupid apps the websites just work both keyboards are a great addition battery life is very good rt is compatible with smart card readers and dod common access card pki software skydrive integration with 200 gig free for 2 yeas microsd card reader integration with windows 8 pcscons microsoft 8217 s poor marketing and the biased reviews who try to tell people rt should run x86 nobody complains that ios doesn 8217 t run full desktop software cost this is a premium machine and you will pay for itthis tablet is really all i use anymore the tipping point for me was the fact that my cac card works with this machine i can log into dod email and other protected websites with my tablet i can 8217 t say the same for android or ios this was the original reason i thought i needed the pro turns out i don 8217 t although i want one 8230 but for no particular reason
