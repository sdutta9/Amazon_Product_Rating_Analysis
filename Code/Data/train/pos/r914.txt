as a foreigner most of the time i just imitate what english speakers say without a deep understanding of how they actually feel emotionally but thanks to the experience with st louis galleria microsoft sore store i actually feel the phrase 34 it sucks 34 i bought a surface pro 3 with them last year and went back for a dell xps 13 i7 version however when i came home and unboxed i found the plastic packaging had obviously been opened i went back for a brand new one and i was told the one i bought was a brand new one at least 4 people there told me it s the 34 signature edition 34 and all the 34 signature edition 34 laptops are opened by 34 technicians 34 to remove bloatware people here even left notes when they scratched my car so i believed them but returned it because it s unimaginable for me that 4 people would lie to me but today i suddenly realized there is another chance for me to feel english if they were telling me the truth then i will feel 34 sorry how stupid i am 34 if they were lying just to sell me the used one then i will feel 34 yeah i was ed 34 anyway it s a terrible experience
