i want to like this tablet so much the screen is so pretty and clear and large but right away there were issues i don t know how to explain the problem but one of my games was having a visual problem meaning that when my life ended the screen wouldn t come back up i could hear the music but i couldn t see the damn caps lock visuals i would have to back out and restart the tablet also when the battery is very low the tablet goes crazy literally the screen scrolls red lines and if i were playing a game the touch screen would go wonky the red lines were obviously the worse part about that what i don t understand is if this tablet has 16 gb internal memory then why when i turned it on before i downloaded anything did it only have less than 1gb left of free space i used my own sd card but even then it would tell me i didn t have enough internal memory for games when i moved all my games to my card the straw however is that the screen stopped working i have had it less than a week and my tablet no longer works i am really upset and returning it i hoped for more i think that the quality control with this company needs improvement if it s a crap shoot if you get a good product or not
