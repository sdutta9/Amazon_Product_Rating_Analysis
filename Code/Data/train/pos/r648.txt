i love this laptop its very well rounded gaming movies music ect the one flaw in this great piece of tech i can say is the audio is slightly lower than expected but added usb speakers when i want a little more sound and the mic still works even with the speakers on so thats also good i would recommend this laptop to anyone who loves good graphics and details in visuals and smooth frame rates
