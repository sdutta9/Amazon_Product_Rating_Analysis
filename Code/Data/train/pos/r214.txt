all the reviews on the microsoft surface 2 is so biased it s sad but i would recommend this device to any student and anyone who really needs work done on the go i mean who really wants to carry around a laptop all day and who wants to get a tablet that s is lacking this and that i brought this tablet and the type cover 2 and that s it i don t have to purchase anything else with skydive my work goes from my surface 2 to my laptop without doing anything but saving my work love it and one note really got rid of all that paper of notes i had everywhere all my notes are organized in one place i heard a lot of students say they had e books to replace there books on the surface 2 but i prefer the physical books now one thing i didn t know but should have guessed lol was that it doesn t support moodle blackboard collaborate but you can turn in your homework and type up and summit your work on the discussion board forums which really shocked me because i thought i wouldn t be able to login period since i couldn t download java learn something new everyday lol this is actually good for me because my classes are a hour long so i go to class then i m gone to the library friend s house grandparent s house love them or etc with nothing but my surface 2 before i barely left my home being an online student because i really didn t feel like taking my laptop everywhere i went and i had work to be done with the surface 2 all my homework is done on the go now my laptop is huge lol and i didn t want to replace it because i paid 700 for it but i wanted something that can do at least half of what it does in a tablet i thought i would never get that but then low and behold the surface 2 hit the shelves you want a replacement for you laptop get the microsoft surface pro or pro 2 i didn t get a chance to use my skype yet but i will soon listening to music out loud isn t to die for it s decent but put some headphones in and wow i m too scared to put it on 100 and this is coming from someone who blast music all the time netflix looks good and the app store is still growing i heard a lot of crying about not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not enough apps but i don t need the same apps on my phone laptop and tablet plus not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not having a certain app isn t make or break my decision or review on any device i even had a blackberry playbook and they were the real definition on lacking apps lol so people be patient it could be playbook worst i also heard confusion about windows rt which confused me because it took me about 2 minutes to see the difference between full windows and windows rt if you don t know the difference save your money and pay a little extra to stick to what you know and go pro or pro 2 by the way i m writing this on my beast the microsoft surface 2 with my type cover 2
