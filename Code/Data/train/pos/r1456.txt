unfortunately i had to return this item because it was frustrating to try to start or boot it without the associated basic windows program that should have come with this item in fairness the seller explained that it is 34 illegal 34 to sell used laptops without having to delete all programs including windows in it i told him that this won t work for me because it is more expensive to get a windows program and install it in this used laptop i am better off just buying a new laptop instead i also told him that i needed this used laptop which i had to mail back to him return to him because i did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not want to carry around my expensive fully loaded laptop with all my important personal and professional documents in it and that i needed this used laptop just when i travel anyway i ended returning this item because it was useless purchasing a used laptop without windows in it this was my second time ever returning a product on line or at a local retailer
