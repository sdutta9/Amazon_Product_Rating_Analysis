beautiful machine looks and feels like a piece of very high end consumer electronics great speed beautiful monitor lots of lovely little touches in the case design and even power adapter that make it feel like a luxury item i use it for extended writing and it s great for that purpose with a very nice keyboard my only quibbles first the touchpad sometimes gets under my fingers as i type as often happens with smaller laptops it ll just take a few days until you ve train yourself to avoid brushing the touchpad as you type second there is no hdmi port just a mini dvi this might require you to buy an adapter and to bring it with you if you re e g using it to give public powerpoints
