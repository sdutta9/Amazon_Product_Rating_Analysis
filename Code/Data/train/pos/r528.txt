this device really works it is a real computer that multitasks runs multiple monitors and is fast enough for everything except serious video editing it converts quickly to a tablet where it has a great touch screen great camera and great wifi reception i bought the base model with 2gig of memory and 64gig of disk space it is plenty fast and there is plenty of disk space for my music pictures and videos if i ever run out of disk space i can insert an sd memory card or upload files to the cloud you can by cheaper tablets but they can t really function as a computer you can pay more for apple s ipad but currently it doesn t really multitask and their keyboard is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not yet released the surface is the current leader i am very happy
