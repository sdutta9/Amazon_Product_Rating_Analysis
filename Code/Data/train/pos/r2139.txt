for the price this is an awesome deal my refurbished laptop arrived looking and running like brand new in fact it s considerably faster than the 800 laptop it replaced it s missing a couple of features than would have been nice side numbers and a webcam but the webcam is pretty much a luxury anyway and i have one on another laptop the reason i bought this was that i had previously bought one for my daughter to start college with and i was so impressed with that one that i purchased a second one it s a workhorse of a computer and takes all that i can throw at is as a web developer and graphic designer in fact i m sick that i spent 1250 on a new toshiba back in january when this one performs just as well i noticed that some other reviews stated problems with some sellers and units that came in with different specs than advertised i was lucky in that mine s exactly as advertised providing you don t have those problems i can t recommend this laptop highly enough dell latitude e6420 premium built 14 1 inch business laptop intel core i5 2 5ghz with 3 2g turbo frequency 4g ram 128g ssd windows 7 professional 64 bit certified refurbished
