there s so many choices out there for laptops and notebooks i was a bit nervous ordering sight unseen but i figured i can t go wrong with dell i ve had other dells that i was very happy with we were surprised and pleased when it came this is a very nice computer for the money the response time and program operation is smooth and quick the sound is good the battery life is respectable the touch screen is very nice responsive this feels sturdy the hinge is tight i ve had touch laptops that were flimsy and you had to basically hold the screen or it would flop over if you touched it the thing i don t like about this we have ipads and a kindle and other touch laptops older this is our first windows 8 laptop so yeah it s a little weird just takes some getting used to we did a lot of where the heck is the but the thing i dislike most was the bloatware on it this sold from amazon so i m guessing it shipped from dell the way dell set it up they put a lot of junk software on there that i ve never heard of some of it seemed to duplicate things already on there there were annoying help tech popup icons that i couldn t get rid of and other stuff that just looked like malware constantly running in programs and services i uninstalled a lot of junk helpers troubleshooters monitors malware protectors etc etc etc none of them were from dell they were all 3rd party software i don t know if dell is getting paid to put that crap on there or what but i prefer the single suite antivirus anti malware approach and if i have computer problems i ll call or email i don t need an annoying smiling icon of some pc tech pinned over the top of my programs telling me to click here for assistance no thanks that stuff can t possibly do your performance any good
