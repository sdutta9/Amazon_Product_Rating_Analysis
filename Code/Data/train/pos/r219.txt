if i could give my tablet six stars i would this is my first tablet purchase after weeks of researching this particular one the limitations of the rt operating system is to be expected so no complaints the tablet does what i need it to do and that s important to me the free bundles of ms office and unlimited skype calls are a refreshing bonus won t get into the tech details but it is a powerhouse by comparison i am very pleased with my purchase here point to note i d recommend purchasing a touch or type cover as well pity it wasn t bundled with the tab
