it is compact boots quickly comes pretty much ready to go and it already has office and defender installed i also like that it has a usb port plus a micro sd card slot underneath the kick stand the magnetic keyboard and charger connectors are slick the only negative i have with it is that any add on is costly such as the cigarette charger or a keyboard keyboards recommend the type keyboard over the touch keyboard the touch has zero tactile feedback so you have to watch where you type or you will be creating nothing but typos i really like the fact that the keyboard doubles as a display cover plus it puts the surface to sleep when you close it chargers there are two types of chargers ac and car cigarette that s it both are 12 volt so don t expect to find any usb style chargers since usb is 5 volts
