i was struggling between surface 2 and surface pro 2 and finally pulled the trigger on surface 2 my initial reason for choosing the surface 2 was price i knew i wanted a windows device but paying north of 1 200 for surface 2 pro with 128gb and keyboard was too risky what if didn t like it what if it ended up collecting dust for my needs surface 2 is perfect this device comes preinstalled with a touch enabled microsoft office which includes outlook basically all i was looking for was a tablet to check my email do some word processing edit spreadsheets browse the web and pay bills online i ve been using kingsoft office on my nexus 7 and galaxy note 8 0 but the experience is nothing to write home about with the surface 2 i can now get some serious work done referring back to the title of this review the reasons why surface 2 is truly something else are as follows 1 the 10 6 inch screen is gorgeous also one finger typing with the onscreen keyboard in portrait mode is rather good this is a good thing because browsing the web just works better in portrait mode 2 battery life is amazing the surface 2 out lasts my nexus 7 2012 with room to spare i guess the whole point of putting windows on an arm device was power consumption intel is closing the gap but surface pro 2 is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not going to give you 10 hours 3 everyone knows surface 2 comes with windows rt if you absolutely need to run x86 apps or have extra cash you should buy the pro i just wanted to mention the positive for running windows rt you don t need to install antivirus software the way i understand it windows rt works like ios 4 surface 2 is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a tablet that is to say surface 2 is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a toy maybe i m too harsh in calling tablets mere toys but the surface 2 just feels different from all my android devices my desktop and laptop computers let s just say i have the surface 2 right by my side while working on my hp desktop or dell laptop choosing a tablet is very much a personal taste my wife would never buy a surface 2 unless it has angry bird or candy crunch i just had to write this review about the best thing since slice bread at least for me
