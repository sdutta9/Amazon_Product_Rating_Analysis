i received the new xps exactly 3 days ago after setting up windows 8 1 i was really liking the small lightweight form factor it had the touchpad was right on the backlit keyboard felt good the second day i installed a few basic applications spotify steam and skype and while browsing the web i had my first bsod blue screen of death i thought it was weird so after it restarted i got online to start researching what was happening when the 2nd one hit then the 3rd one then i went to dell s support website and downloaded their hardware checking software lo and behold while it was running its check the 4th bsod hit you would think that it s software would be compatible with the above programs seeing how popular they are but i completely refreshed the xps to go at it again anyway after configuring windows 8 1 again i was just watching a youtube video when the 5th bsod happened i had enough so i decided to call dell s technical support just to find it was about as worthless as my laptop was i was transferred 3 different times because apparently xps has its own 34 special technicians 34 they determined it a software issue instead of hardware and instead of telling me anything helpful went off on the extra charges i would have to pay to get software support they could barely speak english and weren t very 34 special 34 at all i am currently studying it and work tech support so i know it sucks but they really could do better 0 5 stars for dell s tech support 1 5 stars for my xps although i m sure mine was just a dud so 4 5 if it manages to work just hope you never have to deal with dell s tech support 5 5 stars for amazon and their money back and free returns at least we can rely on somebody
