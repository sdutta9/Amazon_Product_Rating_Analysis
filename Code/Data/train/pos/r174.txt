i was really surprised about all the not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not so great reviews the surface 2 got so i had to put my 2 cents in this is a great tablet with all the bells and whistle plus a full sized usb 3 0 port and a micro sd card slot that is a huge plus in my book i connected my 1tb portable hard drive and space became unlimited you can buy a usb hub and add as many ports you want microsoft included loads of drivers so it can support almost any device that is connected to the usb port the design is very stylish and doesn t feel like a cheap plastic tablet it also has micro hdmi connection seems like a lot of people complain about how can t run exe application on it if you want that go buy a freaking laptop and stop crying this is a tablet and it is meant to run apps designed for tablets that being said microsoft needs to add more apps to their collection and lower the price for the paid apps connect a wireless keyboard and a mouse and you can use it like a pc since it has file explorer full version of ie 11 as well as the metro version with flash support free copy of microsoft office you can use the internet explorer just like you d use it on your pc that means all the online apps games video sites etc transferrig files is a breeze with this thing buy one try it out for 14 days thanks to best buys return policy and if you are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not happy next best thing is an ipad which will cost you 499 tax for 16gb and minus all the ports but at least you will have millions of apps and itunes
