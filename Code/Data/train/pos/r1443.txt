i bought this because i need two gigs of memory and some dental work it s o k but kind of retro i mean a pcmia card slot the problem is it comes loaded with un upgraded windows xp and no anti virus you must bring the updates up to date and then get virus protection microsoft essentials is free then go to firefox with noscript before you do anything else i also put chrome with adblock on it be also advised that support for windows xp support ends this april but the upgrade checker gizmo says you can run windows 8 on it bottom line you can use dragon speak on this and still get that pre molar fixed
