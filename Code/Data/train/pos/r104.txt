memo from a hard core ipad user lets face it surface 1 was a pos loser dirt cheap all day long not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not so with surface 2 microsoft has this this puppy dialed in and i believe will beat up ipad bad i bought one for my daughter who is working on her phd heavily involved in ms office format stuff and was flipping out trying to convert back and forth between her mac laptop this did the job and i did the homework first its cost effective against an ipad it depends on what you need to do with a tablet this is all about ms office get the folio keyboard that is designed for the s2 i finally had a chance to play with this last week ive been away from windows for 3 years so there was a learning curve it s still pretty intuitive and if you use win 8 you ll fall right inscreen resolution is equal to ipad retina its just as fast as ipad 5 one thing i really like about this tablet is usb 3 0 which enable you to add external memory and store docs off the machine you can also use a wired mouse which means you don t have to navigate by touching the screen all the time to navigate faster i 34 think 34 apps can be called up by assigned hot keys didn t get that far its possible to have two app screens open running visable at the same time in many ways s2 does the job where ipad is lacking lots of nice features price is right worth a look only down side is ipad has been around a lot longer with 10 s thousands of apps all the essential apps for s2 appear to be available and i am sure more will appear once s2 gains traction it s definately a competetive viable ipad alternative
