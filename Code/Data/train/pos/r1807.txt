this is my first time purchasing a refurbished unit i am a little bit concerned at the beginning but now i am totally fine since the laptop is just like new the cover is clean and texture feels durable the 15 inch screen size is perfect for me typing on the keyboard is enjoyable the touchpad also works great it also has manufacturer warranty on it i only paid 300 for this wonderful laptop unbelievable
