i ve always been interested in microsoft s surface line but decided to hold off on the device s first generation with the inclusion of microsoft office two years worth of 200 gb skydrive cloud storage i decided to go with the surface 2 tablet along with a purple type cover 2 i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not qualified to compare specs and hardware to other tablets but i can describe my favorite features 1 the surface is a great looking tablet surface s design is what attracted me to it in the first place in an age where their are countless ipad clones and indistinguishable flood of android tablets on the market the surface immediately sets itself apart more importantly surface has a practical design the surface 2 s improved kickstand that now comes with two fixed positions can fit just about any situation lap desk bed etc microsoft designed this product to go hand in hand with their touch and type covers and you really aren t fully experiencing surface without one although it works fine as a standalone tablet since microsoft s touch keyboard is pretty good i can say that the type cover 2 now with back lit keys is a worthwhile accessory to invest in it now comes in multiple colors i also hear the touch cover 2 is a significant improvement over the first generation 2 those free 200 gbs worth of cloud storage and the device s integration with skydrive cannot be overstated already i find myself keeping as much of my work in the cloud as possible and if i m worried about connection the usb 3 0 port allows for easy hands on data transportation on flash drives and even full sized external hard drives this device makes working on the go or across multiple work stations a breeze this coupled with the expandable memory through micro sd makes me question why anyone would ever need more internal storage for the surface 2 if flexibility and mobile work is something you care about the surface 2 is an outstanding choice of tablet 3 surface 2 s battery life allows me to use it all day i can take notes during lectures work on a paper listen to music stream moves all over the course of a day and still have a sufficient charge i then make it back charge it over night and i m good to go another day and often times i don t use it that much so doing all those things was me testing the battery life typically i only use up 10 15 of the charge on a regular day 4 xbox integration it is awesome earning xbox achievements on the go with mobile games you also have access to xbox video and xbox music i had a brief problem connected to my xbox video account the first week and i don t know if it was an update or what but now i can stream my xbox video movies and tv shows with ease this is a great product pure and simple ever since i got my surface 2 i ve found that i only need my laptop when i m working on more demanding tasks such as gaming photoshop and video editing i don t think the surface 2 running windows rt is by any means a laptop replacement but it is an outstanding tablet for work and media consumption if you re looking for a portable device that works within the microsoft ecosystem runs office is integrated with the cloud and is just practical for quick and easy on the go work the surface 2 is an outstanding choice notes will update with time keep at least 3gbs free on your surface 2 s internal storage your local drive needs to have at least 3gbs free to access and make use of skydrive trust me those 200gbs of free cloud storage are worth it freeze ups sometimes if you re running too many apps for too long on surface 2 it can freeze up this isn t a major problem and doesn t happen often enough for me to change my rating if you need to restart the device hold down the home button at the bottom of the tablet and the power button until it vibrates this will get you up and running in no time
