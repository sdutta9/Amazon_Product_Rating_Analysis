ok first off this is a great laptop i bought from the seller all about pc parts and cannot say enough good things about this guy it really does matter what seller you buy from on amazon and this guy is amazing he shipped my pc very quickly it came with 2 4 ghz instead of 2 0 and a better battery he listens to his customers and cares and upgraded my ram from 2 mb to 3 mb for only 10 extra plus he gave me a 9 cell battery which has a long battery life lol i felt like i needed to spread the good word about how good the seller all about pc parts is on here i recommend anyone to buy from this seller because they over deliver and care about their customers my laptop looks brand new nearly so now to the laptop for the price of around 150 total this cannot be beat its fast works great and looks great great deal here guys
