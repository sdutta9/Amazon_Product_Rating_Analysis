it isn t perfect but it suits my needs really well and overall i think it s one of the best tablets out there definitely recommended i don t own a laptop and now i really don t need one this thing is great having said that pros office full office i commute to school and i don t have a laptop so in the 4 hours between classes i can do my homework no other tablet has this feature keyboard covers even the touch cover works pretty well i often forget this is a tablet and tend to use it like a laptop actual stereo speakers the sound is loud enough and it s nice to actually get stereo separation the screen is really nice even if it s 34 only 34 1080p battery life is pretty good i can browse the web all day watch a couple tv shows on hulu and still have juice left over for the next day it syncs my settings from my desktop so everything i m used to is already there plus it s windows so i don t feel like i am using a limited tablet cons limited app selection but honestly i don t even notice you can access everything through the web sites anyway so the only really notable exceptions are games which i don t really play on a tablet anyway still some bugs to work out i and many other users have had to refresh the os to be able to turn off the typing sounds when using the touch cover 2 really shouldn t have to do that also it sometimes won t wake up from sleep and has to be manually shut down and booted back up not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the worst thing in the world but it just isn t quite there yet since it is windows rt you can t install regular windows programs not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the end of the world but it would be fun to have say minecraft they do give us office though hopefully more developers will program for rt
