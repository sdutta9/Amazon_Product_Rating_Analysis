i bought this for my brother after this laptop crashed motherboard i was daunted that i will have to be buy another for him in a 2 years as this is what i could have afforded for him however as soon as i unboxed it i was very pleased came with windows 7 instead of the advertised xp it looks awesome and sturdy makes you feel confident that it was build to last
