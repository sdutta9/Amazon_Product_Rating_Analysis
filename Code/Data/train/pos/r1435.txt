the laptop arrived very quickly and it looked and performed just like a new laptop i was very impressed with how the laptop looked and how well it performed even more impressive was that i had a question regarding the laptop s wireless connection and their customer service person was extremely helpful professional and customer service oriented turned out it was this specific laptop s on off wireless switch that needed to be manually turned back on i will definitely recommend tampa laptops to all my friends and relatives
