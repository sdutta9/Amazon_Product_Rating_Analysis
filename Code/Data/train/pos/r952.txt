first i want to say that this is a beautiful piece of equipment it has nice little touches with the carbon fiber around the keyboard and the aluminum cover it s a well designed laptop that s very light and even though they shrank the size the keys don t feel crammed together however the touch pad is terrible and the keyboard consistently registers multiple touches i ve spent 4 months with dell s customer service and had two touch pad replacements to no avail at this point i can t type on it and i can t use the touch pad so it s basically a pretty doorstop dell s customer service just keeps reinstalling drivers and reinstalling the operating system hoping that ll fix the problem but after 4 months and still the same story it s just a faulty device my last call with customer service the rep told me that the problem was on my end and that i didn t know how to use a touch pad or a keyboard although the internet is full of people with the same problems this will be my last dell purchase in my lifetime
