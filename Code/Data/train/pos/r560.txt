i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not into spending too much time on reviews but thoughts i d share since these things are expensive i bought this as an upgrade from the surface pro 3 which i used the crap out of for a year as a web developer and traveling gaming rig here are my thoughts so far positive visual studio runs brilliantly faster than the lenovo core i7 i have to use for work the vertical screen space at 3 2 is so superior to any 16 9 10 display on common laptops and even the mbp for productive work build and screen quality equivalent to macbook pro keyboard and trackpad are great works great for most games after some tweaking you can tell there s a graphics card inside at 1 gb memory you have to scale down a bit but you can still achieve respectable frame rates for solo play unliike the ipad pro you can play real fps games detach the screen and you have an awesome tablet sans apps of course phenomenal really you can plug the charge cable into the 34 bottom 34 of the screen to charge it independently of the base if you need to but the cable is magnetic and falls off easily screen is large enough that i don t crane like i have been with the surface pro 3 no font scaling required either 34 tent 34 mode is wonderful for movies and games with a controller and reading news in bed 2 usb ports yay negative touchpad doesn t always work with chrome two finger scrolling must restart chrome for scrolling to work other times it disappears completely there are a lot of blue screens of death when detaching the screen other times it locks up completely i consciously save work and close down anything that involves video before switching modes i thought battery life would be longer indicators always show 60 7 hours total remainingsummary i look for excuses to pick up this laptop and use it even for gaming
