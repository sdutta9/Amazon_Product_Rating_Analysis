here are the pros as i see them the price the price the price the weight is much lighter than my i7 high end laptop battery lasts 5 7 5 hours depending on use many windows laptops in this price range only last 3 hours so this is a huge advantage a large 15 6 inch screen for a great price this cpu doesn t run hot at all and has decent performance for the price keyboard feels nice and doesn t feel too cheap we will see with time though how it holds up trackpad works good buttons are loud when clicked though nice to have a windows laptop for this price i like chromebooks but i can t connect to my at home samba server from a chromebook so i gravitate to windows
