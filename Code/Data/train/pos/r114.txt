the surface 2 is a whoole lot faster than the first one a lot of my classes assign online homework which requires flash i can do them all on this the multitasking lets me open two books at once awesome for reading the solutions manual while i am reading the textbook the office suite is great word is the best i can input my lab data with excel powerpoint for those rare presentations and such also the keyboards for it are better than any keyboard ive used with my moms ipad its a full size keyboard so typing is always easy and it fits perfectly well with tge device but it does add a little more weight althought you wouldnt really be holding it anyways given that you get an integrated kick stand its nice having a tablet that runs the full office suite with no compromise plus i can connect to any printer even those that dont support wireless printing such as mine through the usb port plus i can charge my phone with the usb port the usb port is especially awesome because in the first two weeks of school everyone is trying to get the pdf s makes sharing a lot easier between classmates this is the best productivity tablet there is given that its the only one lol but i like where microsoft is going with this i went over a relatives house a few weeks ago twho lived about three hours away but i forgot my surface they had an ipad so i thought hey i can experiment with that after the first day i couldn t stand using the ipad anymore the smart cover kickstand was flimsy compared to the surfaces integrated kickstand i didnt quite trust it and all of the durable kickstands for the ipad seemed bulky and heavy no flash on the ipad so no online hw for me that day eventually i needed to borrow their laptop to do the writing portion of my studies which i could have just done on my surface the small ipad keyboard just didnt do it for me oh and my phone died before i moved to the laptop so no charging my phone with the ipad while i listen to music on my phone for me to sum up if your in for productivity the surface is a damn good device i haven t touched my laptop except to transfer files to my surface in about 9 months
