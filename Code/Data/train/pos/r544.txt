i recently purchased the microsoft surface 3 this product is all in all great and reasonably priced i m very pleased with it thus far i bought it in purpose for school my laptop is too big and heavy to carry in my backpack around campus all day this tablet is light weight durable and the perfect size not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not big like a laptop but not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not too small like a kindle functions and features the main reason i got a tablet was to replace my laptop and it does just that it has a nice desktop setting that allows you to save documents pictures and downloads just like a computer would the surface 3 is better than an ipad because it has microsoft office on it which allows to use word excel and one note these programs work great for taking notes or writing papers in class you can also get apps and games like you would on an ipad this device has a wonderful screen resolution projecting a great picture which makes it nice to watch movies or netflix battery life when i first got the microsoft surface 3 it took about 3 hours to fully set up and sync once the initial setup is done this product runs fast and loads quickly it turns on fast and keeps its battery life for a fairly long period of time however if you stream music or movies on it your battery will discharge more quickly one thing i noticed is that this device takes a while to charge up so i plug it in at night and then it s good to go in the morning when i leave for school accessories i would recommend when buying the microsoft surface 3 to get the pen and keyboard to go along with it that is my biggest regret thus far while the touch screen is very easy to use when using word excel and onenote a keyboard would make it a lot easier to type the pen would also make the touch screen a little more user friendly when clicking on specific links or trying to right click the microsoft surface 3 is a great product and works perfect for school i highly recommend this product especially for any student considering to buy a tablet for notes class purposes
