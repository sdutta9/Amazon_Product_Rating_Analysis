i m writing from this laptop now i still need to get used to te keyboard but it is very nice the touchscreen works very well and the battery life is reasonable once you mess around with it in settings windows 8 does take some getting used to but it is very sleek and user friendly probably the only thing i don t like so far is that the mouse pad clicker why can t i think of what this is whatever you call it it s pretty loud but so far that s my only complaint i also wish it would come with microsoft office but hey can t have everything for this great a price i do recommend getting this laptop
