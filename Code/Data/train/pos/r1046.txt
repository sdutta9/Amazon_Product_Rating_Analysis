this is my experience with my this stupid laptop it doesn t matter if its the software or the hardware its still my experience with this laptop nsound it somehow got worse and worse and watching netflix is no longer enjoyable on this laptop the sound is broken you can still make sense of the sounds but it s just a broken dvd ndisplay it was great i loved the screen display but the shock wave plugin started to crash since i got the laptop so it stopped youtube videos and netflix all the time and the only way to fix it was to restart the laptop every single time nkeyboard i thought it would be great but it wasn t so good the keyboard was a bit unresponsive but it wasn t a huge deal ntochcreen better than i thought so that was great ni have been taking care of the laptop since it cost me alot but i dont know if i can afford to buy another one i don t recommend this laptop at all at this price
