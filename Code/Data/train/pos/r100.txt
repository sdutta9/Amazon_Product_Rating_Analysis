let me start by saying that it took me a long time to make the decision to purchase the surface 2 i had followed the product ever since the surface rt came out and spent a great deal of time reading reviews studying tech specs and sampling the product at my local electronics store given the negative reviews i decided to stay away from the original surface the rt however when the surface 2 came out and most users experiences were positive i decided to go ahead and take the plunge man am i glad that i did this device is exactly what i was looking for its small and lightweight it comes pre installed with a full version of microsoft office and the sky drive integration is seamless with my desktop applications i also run windows 8 1 on my desktop i purchased the 64 gb version and installed a 64 gb micro sd card so i have a full 128 gb of storage i am not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a huge media consumer although i do have music and a few movies installed for long flights and with 128 gb i find have almost 50 gb free and clear even with several movies installed locally their are a few things to be mindful of 1 i would defiantly get the type cover 2 i can t really comment on the other types of covers but the tc 2 works very well and the backlighting feature is very useful 2 as others have said i would recommend an external mouse the usb port makes it very simple to install a bluetooth doggie for a mouse and keyboard as well if you want i don t find a big need for the keyboard but the mouse does make navigation inside of spreadsheets or power point documents much easier 3 stability surrounding updates is a bit problematic if you interrupt the update process it tends to lock up the device my advice is just leave it alone while it is updating and everything will be fine 4 the lack of apps that so many people bemoan is really a non event for me i have found that the microsoft app store has everything that i really need on this device for the stuff that is missing i have just created short cut links to the respective webpages i find i have effectively the same functionality just working through the web google earth is the one exception although with it being installed in my desktop and iphone i don t find that to be a huge issue overall after three weeks of use the surface 2 had significantly exceeded my expectations and i am very satisfied with my purchase
