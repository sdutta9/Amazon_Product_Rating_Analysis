i received the inspiron i7348 5001slv signature edition on friday and it s now sunday and i m ready to share my thoughts the short version is i think i ll keep it it s lighter than my 11 6 34 acer not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a netbook that i ve had for four years and i appreciate the additional screen real estate without additional weight i ve been running win 10p on the acer and loving it but will wait a little longer before adding it to this device even though i am looking forward to doing so i wasn t sure i d like or use the 2 in 1 table feature but have quickly fallen in love with it i very much appreciate the different aspect ratio available by flipping to tablet mode and reading documents or perusing spreadsheets in portrait as opposed to typical landscape mode on a regular screen surfing websites is better this way as well as for the screen i also wasn t sure i d use the touch screen but i was wrong i ll probably struggle now working with my desktop while in the office as i m sure i ll be reaching up to tap the screens regularly but oh well i ll adjust to that new paradigm and will just enjoy the new interface option the included stylus is a nice touch that i ve also found more useful than i imagined i ever would the only real negative i ve found with this device and it s a pretty big one is the ridiculously poor touchpad i struggled with a poor one on my previous acer and thought this couldn t be any worse but i was wrong about that too it s terrible in fact i ve decided to just carry a small mouse with me and enable the setting to disable the touchpad when a mouse is attached that works but i would expect much better from dell and others regarding touchpad sensitivity issues i would have given it 5 stars without question if it weren t for the touchpad even so i d still recommend this device overall update 4 apr 2015 i ve had this for 3 weeks now and thought i d share an update to my experiences i m tempted to up the review to 5 stars but will leave it at 4 since i think dell should have done something a little better with the touchpad i ve adjusted the sensitivity and it s better but i still use a mouse except when it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not convenient better but i came across a great deal on a samsung 850 evo 250gb ssd here on amazon and couldn t pass it up i have ssd s in my desktop and my old laptop and liked the performance improvement in speed and battery life and curiosity got the best of me so i jumped wow as fast as this new dell was before everything is nearly instantaneous now it boots to a log on prompt in about 10 seconds and shuts down in less than 5 waking from sleep is nearly instant as is opening every program i have including ie chrome all ms office programs and any others i really was shocked at this as the hybrid hdd was supposed to be so fast to start with i believe it was but again with wow go for it if you re curious or you just want your new toy to scream i don t believe i could be happier overall yeah except the touchpad and would buy this again in an instant in fact i offered to get one for my wife but she s happy with her acer and i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not going to argue to spend money if she doesn t want it update 23 april 2015 i ve had this for almost 6 weeks now and would buy another in a heartbeat not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a single problem or glitch and no signs of any problems large or small i haven t used my ipad in over a month now as i wanted to try using this device in tablet mode instead so i could eliminate one piece of equipment i carry while travelling so far it s been ok in that regard but perhaps that s as much because i want it to work there are some apps available on itunes that aren t available in the ms app store some is being kind to ms however for every 34 missing 34 app i ve found i can simply go to the website for the company without the app and work through their website directly there are actually a number of sites that i prefer using their websites for better than their apps but that s a matter of personal choice so far so good update 24 september 2015 i ve had this for 6 months now and would still buy another in a heartbeat it s definitely a gem in my book in fact i liked it so much i bought an 11 34 for my daughter to replace the old acer i d handed down to her when i got this i upgraded her to an ssd also and it boots a few seconds fast than mine now d oh she uses it regularly at school and says all her friends and a couple of instructors have commented on how much they liked it s functionality both of us are running windows 10 mine is still the upgrade while i did a clean install on hers after the upgrade i suspect that s why her s is a little quicker than mine now guess what i ll be doing the next time i have a few hours to do mine best to all
