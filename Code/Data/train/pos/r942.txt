my laptop is an i7 with a 256gb ssd and 8mb ram i love this machine i bought it to replace my yoga 13 and this machine totally blows the lenovo out of the water the fit finish is light years ahead of the lenovo as is the display the lenovo feels flimsy and it is plus the lack of bloatware on the dell is a huge advantage this is a lightweight machine that packs a lot of punch the only drawback that i ve seen so far is the lack of an hdmi port however that s an easy fix with the help of an adapter the battery life is very good too
