amazing i wound up adding the samsung evo 850 500gb m 2 sata hard drive which fit perfectly and it s the nicest computer i ve ever owned works great with windows or linux i m using xubuntu 15 10 rc2 on linux i set the dpi to 136 which makes most apps legible on windows 10 it decided to scale to 150 which is a bit large but works
