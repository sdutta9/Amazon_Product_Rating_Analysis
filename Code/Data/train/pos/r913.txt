this laptop is great the build quality is excellent and definitely a lot better than i was expecting from dell the 34 infinity 34 display looks fantastic has great colors and viewing angles and the 1080p resolution is great for the size you don t have to mess with scaling the keyboard feels great the backlighting for it is a nice touch and the touchpad isn t bad at all it has a great feel and the built in clicking buttons are pretty nice the battery usually lasts me a full day of normal web browsing and using office software for school work along with some video playback the size and weight make it really easy to carry around in my backpack and the power adapter is very portable and comes with a wall adapter in which case you can ditch one of the cables for it my only complaint would be the low amount of ram 4gb is generally fine and i don t really use this laptop for any intensive tasks but it would still have been nice to at least have the option to increase that amount in the future but that s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not possible what it comes with it what you re stuck with would definitely have liked more customization ability in terms of which processor ram ssd size combination one would like overall it s a great laptop the build quality is great it s speedy and the display alone makes up for any of the minor issues it may have
