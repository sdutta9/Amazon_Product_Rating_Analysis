great price good enough memory and touch screen is a plus runs fast my only complaint is the speakers they suck there s constant feedback the packaging also could have been a little better it could have been damaged so if you re looking for a student laptop or something to store your music and pictures its great for the price but if you need something with good speakers then this one isn t the one for you
