i have recently bought this computer and i wanted to say that i love it the dell inspiron 300 is a really nice machine and it was super easy to get setup it didn t take me long to get used to the product but i sometimes like to consider myself a bit of a tech geek i ve also had dell computers my whole life so maybe that s why it was so easy for me the price was greater how good this computer actually is and it even comes with windows10 the screen is super clear and the speakers are really good as well it s a really great computer for studying and it s even better because of the great price
