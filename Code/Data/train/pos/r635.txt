very nice laptop for the price very good performance and respectable battery life not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not for games of course but for everything else this machine is amazing install an ssd onto this machine and you get a laptop that rivals a desktop in speed i installed an ssd onto this machine and it absolutely flies runs very nicely with linux mint as long as you use an updated linux kernel that has the drivers for this laptop battery life is very respectable usually lasting 4 6 hours the screen is a matte screen and it s surprisingly nice i honestly expected a terrible tn display but i was pleasantly surprised good build quality for the price cons no removable hard drive cover no removable battery viewing angles could be better that s right you have to open up the laptop completely to get to the battery and hard drive wasn t a big deal for me but i can see this being an issue for some the keyboard is a bit flimsy but i can t really complain for the price there has to be some drawbacks here also no touchscreen in case you didn t already know all in all i m very happy with my purchase
