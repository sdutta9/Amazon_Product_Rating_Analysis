bought this for my daughter at an amazing low price for the spec thought it would take me all day to set up and get used to windows 8 1 as i m on 7 expected to have to read through normal thick manual etc but windows 8 1 is truly amazing as loaded everything automatically found her infinity b band itself etc etc whole set up start to finish was less than 2 hours the laptop works like a new computer very fast and stable so if you are hesitating about buying this because of fear of being refurbished then don t worry
