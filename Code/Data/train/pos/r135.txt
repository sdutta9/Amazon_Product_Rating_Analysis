first off my wife and i were surprised of how small this tablet is it is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not really a big tablet so i would recommend checking it out first at a store after about a week my wife started to really like it because of its size where you can bring it much anywhere it does come with office excel and word which is all you really need if you are using it for personal or school use remember this does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not come with a keyboard so be prepared to spend another 100 dollars for that one thing i wish i would of done was do more research because the tablet is expensive especially with the keyboard i did find an asus along with other windows 8 tablets with keyboards and they were cheaper by a long shot also hp is coming out with a new windows 8 tablet soon and i have always been a fan of hp nothing i can say about windows 8 besides it is excellent i have used ipads and apple products and i have to say soon microsoft will be taking a bigger chunk out of the market because this is much better than what apple has to offer i would of given it a 5 but the price is way to much for what you get in terms of memory and hard drive space i really cannot mention hard drive because if you have a windows email account sky drive is free and it stores everything off sight and is always available even if you don t have your computer one final note the web cam is very good and takes great video and photos
