i have been using my surface 2 for 8 to 10 hours per day for about five weeks straight now i like it very much the keyboard cover is important for usability it s an extra purchase but it really enables good content creation i use all four of the office products outlook word excel powerpoint i haven t tried anything really fancy like macros but for basic tasks the office suite is very usable the usb drive is actually the reason i got the surface instead of an ipad the usb drive is really useful for convenient file sharing i also use onenote to sync automatically with other devices onenote is pre installed since the surface 2 runs rt i can t download many regular windows applications for screenshots i use the charm send to function i send to onenote then copy from onenote and paste into windows or the charm email facility i email myself screenshots both techniques are functional but seem a little clumsy compared to a true windows application such as godwin i can t run a full fledged computer programming interactive development environment that is too advanced for rt but i can use remote desktop connection to connect to a windows server on a cloud provider like amazon web service i installed metro putty from the store and that allows me to connect to a hosted linux server in the cloud by the way the surface 2 only runs its own internet explorer browser no chrome or firefox allowed this restriction does cause an issue occasionally because some sites don t run correctly on the ie browser as an easy workaround i sign into my above mentioned windows server and use chrome there my favorite features are its weight and its coolness i have read it weighs in at two pounds i guess that s right i can t tell exactly but it feels light i can keep it on my lap for hours and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not feel weighed down it feels light in my briefcase as far as temperature it never heats up or if it does i ve never noticed it i ve experienced two glitches first it is possible to think that your keyboard is attached when in fact it is magnetized but not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not actually attached i spent a while trying to discern the pattern of why sometime the keyboard worked and sometime the keyboard failed it was completely a matter of making sure the contacts are actually connected between the keyboard and the surface the other glitch is related to the sleep function when i actively sleep the machine and then wake it later it is sometimes mostly unresponsive i have learned to keep it on all day and then actively do a shut down sometimes if i walk away from the machine and then it times out and sleeps when i return i have to power it off and then power it back on to ensure it s fully responsive this is annoying but all the conveniences of the device far outweigh this issue as this review indicates i literally tell my family occasionally 34 i love my surface 34 everybody loves hearing about an unexpected good surprise my family members just smile and they say they don t get tired of hearing me say it
