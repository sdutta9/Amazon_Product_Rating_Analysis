the laptop was a bit slow and when i unpluged the power the monitor dimmed i am an it professional and i did every setting and even contacted dell they did the same things i did and it still didn t work since it was 2 days old i just returned it i got the hp touchsmart 15 f010dx 15 6 34 touch screen much much better faster but the dell case seem tighter but who really cares about the case on a 300 laptop
