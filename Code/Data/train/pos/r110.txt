pros 1 this thing is fast and i mean really fast 2 great battery life3 outstanding operating system microsoft listened to customer feedback it really shows with the 8 1 update 4 the web browser i know its internet explorer but in the 10 inch tablet market it s definitely the best right now in both speed and functionality 5 the new kick stand it s just plain awesome 6 great screen quality 7 the windows speech recognition application allows for full voice control of the os and speech to text in office 8 plug in a pc or 360 controller and you have a portable gaming box install some emulators from the apps store and get some retro gaming going 9 media casting you can stream music photos and movies to other devices i ve only tested this with my 360 and it works great 10 multiple user accounts if you have family or friends that uses your tablet this is extremely useful cons 1 the lack of applications not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a big deal anymore but it still has some catching up to do i m impressed with how much they ve managed to catch up being that the win 8 store is only a little over a year old using ios as the app store standard one tends to forget it s over 6 years old now 2 it doesn t make me a sandwich
