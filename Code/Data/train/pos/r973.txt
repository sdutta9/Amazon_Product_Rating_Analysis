this is our first windows laptop as we were coming from a used macbook we are very happy with it s performance the speed of the i3 processor is great and the touchscreen is very responsive i was concerned that this was a refurbished unit but i have not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not seen any issues with it motherboard replacement was very easy because a drink was spilled on it bonus to dell
