i own the surface 2 and the ipad retina both have same but different uses i use my surface as a desktop more than a tablet using it as a desktop i bought the wireless mouse hdmi adapter for my monitor and the 5 to 1 adapter the adapter allows you more options such as an additional much needed usb port i like the abilty to use microsoft office making the tablet a good choice if ms office was out of the question the ipad is probably a better choice
