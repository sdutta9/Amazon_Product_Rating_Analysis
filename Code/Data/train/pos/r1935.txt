i have this for a little while now and i really like it i don t usually buy dell as i find them over priced but on amazon it seemed like a good deal but don t you know a day or so later it was running with a 50 off incentive always happens i likely won t use it for anything very powerful as in programs but so far it is great at cruising the internet and ms office document writing editing etc windows 10 is easy to use and generally i like it as well
