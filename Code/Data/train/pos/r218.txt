i was given this product as a gift for christmas and was overly excited when i started using the tablet everything was fine until i charged the tablet all the way and removed the power cord this caused phantom touching on the screen and was unusable unless the power cord was attached i then returned this tablet and got a different one that has the same issue in addition to this issue the screen now also flickers and freezes the whole system i am returning the tablet tomorrow and am looking into something more reliable
