i purchased a refurbished dell latitude d630 paying about as much as a low end brand new laptop my reason for getting a refurbished computer is because i wanted to continue to use windows xp and this was a way to get a new computer that still used xp i also wanted to still be able to use my old programs and hardware that are still compatible with xp i refuse to use vista and windows 7 is marginal but i don t like it and it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not compatible with a few of my programs out of the box it worked perfectly unfortunately it only worked perfectly for about a month now i can see why it was sent back to dell it will randomly crash and shut down and now that i have owned it for several months it s too late to return it to amazon don t bother with a refurbished computer just go get a new one with a full warranty if it s been refurbished there s a reason that someone else sent it back
