it s okay because it s pointless to use it as 34 tablet in a hand 34 will feel heavy after holding it longer the area of fan exhaust will become too warm and uncomfortable for your hand to hold will be fine if you lay and use it on desk table or laps i don t see the software option to force cpu to run in lower speed for light use with cooler temp i really like its built in stylus including holder
