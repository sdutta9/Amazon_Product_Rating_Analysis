this computer has been more problems than it s worth the wifi quits working randomly so i have to restart the computer several times a day the mouse pad freezes several times a day and it takes 10 30 seconds to unfreeze i spent extra on this to get the upgraded ram and it s worse than the cheapo i got from sams club wouldn t buy it again
