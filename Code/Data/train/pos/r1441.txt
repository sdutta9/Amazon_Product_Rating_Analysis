i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the product it arrived in 3 days from ordering and i was worried about christmas delivery it was packaged great loaded with everything my son will need and more the case had minor scratches but its for a 15 year old boy so im sure it will look worse i would recommend this seller and product again in fact 2 of my other kids are wanting to buy from them
