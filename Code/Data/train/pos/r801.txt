this was my first laptop a 2014 christmas gift all around it s a good high quality laptop especially if you re a student i wanted it for digital art programs like gimp photoshop and paint tool sai and it works spectacularly the big screen makes the view really easy and connecting a graphics tablet i ve only used wacom and huion so far is no problem glitches occasionally the cursor won t show up on the screen or when i click on something on the screen it ll only do a left mouse click instead of right these are small things that can be fixed with restarting or shutting down the laptop but it can get annoying battery life the battery life is pretty good i can usually go about 7 8 hours of constant heavy duty use i could type a paper while streaming netflix and listening to it with bluetooth headphones with the keyboard backlight on the laptop can do this for a good 7 hours weight and size it s a little heavy especially with one shoulder laptop bags for travel i would suggest either a backpack or a one shoulder bag with a really good cushion the size makes it a little awkward to sit in certain positions but that s nothing to worry about final thoughts if it were an option this would 4 5 5 stars it s nearly perfect for what i use it for but being a teen i like being able to travel and move with it but it s a tad bit tedious and the glitches leave you feeling a little impatient
