the headlines pretty much said how i felt about it you know that you have something which you value when you are thinking about getting a similar one as a spare not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not because you feel the one in your hands it unreliable because you know that accidents do happen and you would hate to be without something this efficient for an extended period of time i purchased one two years ago at what i considered to be a good price and i just got another one because to me the price was soo right they are both performing superbly one word of caution though in buying computers new or old but especially old yopu want to try and make sure that you know exactly what you are getting for your money i wish that amazon would require of their vendors that they post more complete descriptions when it comes to something like a computer which carries a big price tag and does include many details and components parts however since they don t make it a point to contact the potential vendor by email with some direct questions before making a purchase just because the general product description says one thing does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not guarantee that it applies to the one you are buying case in point my second laptop came with a 60gb harddrive even though in the general description for the dell 630 laptop it says an 80gb harddrive this is still fine by me because 60 gb from my point of view and my needs is still substantial and the device does include all of the features which prompted me to make the purchase in the first place what i am saying is this it is usually better to know exactly what you are getting into beforehand
