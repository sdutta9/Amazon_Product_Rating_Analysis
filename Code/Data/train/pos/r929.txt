i bought this from dell i would highly recommend buying this directly from the company because of the warranty and technical support and best of all they gave me a coupon for 100 off which brought the price down to 799 the wifi kept dropping when i first received it so i chatted with tech support about it and they walked me through adding drivers and bios after that i haven t had an issue with it fast light computer with a beautiful display i bought the matte 1080p and wow the resolution is spectacular i decided not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not to get the touch screen because of the glare and smudges i had to deal with with my last laptop windows 8 was easily upgradable to 10 so was very happy with that i would highly recommend this little computer
