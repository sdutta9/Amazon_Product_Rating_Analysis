a pretty good product for the money i am a software and web development student and needed an affordable new laptop that could handle microsoft visual studio and netbeans as well as microsoft sql management studio i also need to do basic word processing and use google applications so far this is working well enough and while it does slow somewhat while multitasking it gets by i will probably upgrade the ram at some point as well as swap out the hard drive for an ssd but out of the box this laptop was able to handle everything i ve thrown at it the i3 processor seems totally fine for most tasks another bonus i didn t seem to find too much bloatware installed on the computer either sure there was a lot of ms stuff and the obligatory candy crush but nothing else too intrusive the display is high resolution hd but is somewhat limited in terms of viewing angles when you view the display straight on however it looks bright and sharp out of the box text appears very small since the resolution is so high i ve been able to make some adjustments to increase readability but it s still not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not great i am 30 years old and have pretty good vision and i still have a hard time reading text within applications and web browsers as for build quality you get what you pay for the chassis is cheap and plasticy with no metal features but it is acceptable the keyboard is pleasant to type on but does make a cheap loud plastic clacking noise the keyboard does also flex as you type but it doesn t bother me the keyboard was a major factor for me since i do so much typing as a developer and this keyboard met all my needs the speakers are acceptable too though sound a bit muffled and tinny at times they re also pretty loud battery life is average and the quot ice cool quot palm rest is just marketing gimmick i didn t notice any difference with any laptop i ve used previously overall the laptop works very well for what i ve needed it looks sharp and is fast enough for most common tasks if you need decent machine to do routine tasks this one offers a good value for the money
