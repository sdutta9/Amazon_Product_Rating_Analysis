i am writing this review on a dell inspiron 3541 with the 4gb memory and 500 gb hard drive i purchased this with a fair discount through my employer s discount arrangement with dell and i am frankly unimpressed and regret it the two best descriptors for this laptop are cheap and flimsy the case is very thin lightweight plastic which gives the user no faith whatsoever in its ability to survive day to day usage i have to wrap this in a thick towel just to put it in my carrying bag to take it out of the house the stock memory is just barely enough to run windows 10 and since it has only one dimm slot you ll need to budget another 50 to get a replacement 8gb memory stick if you want to do more than surf the net and send email not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not that it is capable of much more the amd a6 6310 processor brings to mind a line from the weird al song its all about the pentiums what kind of chip you got in there a dorito i used to have a cheesy hp netbook with a dinky celeron that seemed to have more juice than this processor the keyboard keys are already failing if you rest your wrists on the case the cursor will jump around the screen and the machine randomly restarts on the supposed plus side this model has a touch screen i say supposed because i don t use it but i suppose that someone else might the battery on the other hand has a good six hour life to it in balanced or dell mode but i ve only had it for less than a month so i can t say if it will last for any great length of time overall if you can find this on sale for about 250 or so don t mind uninstalling a lot of the startup junkware that bogs the processor down and are only going to use it for simple tasks the inspiron 3541 might be a decent purchase for you for me my faith in dell as a serious brand has taken a big hit because of this thing
