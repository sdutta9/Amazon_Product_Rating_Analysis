i bought my first refurbished laptop about 5 6 years ago because it was inexpensive and i typically use it on trips so if it gets stolen i wouldn t lose a new laptop but i had a very good experience with it so i ve continued to buy refurbished ones for other members of my family when i see good ones at a good price and this dell d630 is the case the condition of my d630 is very good the keyboard looks new and there s no dust on it there are some scratches on the bottom of the case but i can live with that every refurbished computer will be different though so you mileage will vary it really depends on how the last corporate users used it if it s a low usage computer then you ve got a good deal function it s got a core2duo processor which is newer than the pentiums but older than the new icores it still has 2 cpu s in it i upgraded mine to 4gb ram one of the cheapest and best way to upgrade your laptop and the os to windows7 64 bit ram is so cheap nowadays i automatically upgrade all of my computers to the max but do it yourself as it s often cheaper than having the vendor do it even with windows7 this runs very fast i use this mainly for surfing but even with multiple browsers and multiple tabs running this thing is fast right now i m very satisfied with it especially at the refurbished price if you can get a good price go for it if something is really worn out or needs replacing sometimes a complaint to the vendors may solve your problem but if they won t getting replacement parts is pretty cheap too you can find replacements all over the internet so if you re like me want a low priced laptop that you travel a lot with get one of these
