at first i wasn t too interested in getting a laptop tablet however my sister s first laptop was a dell mini and if it wasn t for the speed i would have been interested in getting one i saw this at a local store and decided to research it yes we already had samsung tablets however considering the fact that the entire tablet is a touch screen you can accidentally touch the screen and throw off the navigation we already had 15 laptops but comparing using this to using a 15 this was much easier to handle i could only find one speed test online but it handled 1080p video with relative ease it seemed rather impressive for a small laptop furthermore intel seems to have made great strides in their celeron series because this performed far better compared with the mini mind you the mini was back in 2009 and it had an atom one quirk i found was when i was upgrading to windows 10 the upgrade went successful but i had no control over the brightness setting it was staying dim when i came back from work the next day i connected the laptop to the internet and let it upgrade itself i don t know which upgrade it was or just the fact that i did a dell system detect but it resolved the brightness issue the one downside i ve found is when i tried to upgrade my hard drive i had a 1tb i was going to use to replace the 500gb when i put the 1tb in the screws wouldn t screw down all the way furthermore when i put my laptop back together it was bulging i made sure the laptop still worked before i completely put it back together and the bulge isn t affecting performance the bulge is so gradual that you ve have to look at it from the side to even notice it anyways occasionally the keyboard doesn t want to work but that problem is intermittent i ve ordered a 7mm 1tb hd on amazon for under 100 this does mean that i ll be spending a little more on a used 270 laptop but i think the investment outweighs the extra costs
