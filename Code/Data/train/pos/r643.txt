i ve had this computer for a little over a week and have used it on and off daily mostly for the internet to become familiar with win10 i wanted a laptop with win10 factory installed and when i came across this 350 deal with a 1080 screen i couldn t pass it up while i waited for the order to be filled i went to local stores to compare sub 500 laptops i think that the build quality is comparable to others in its class my take screen bright with good colors and text at the 1920 x1080 resolution everything is very sharp sound quality very good set at 50 volume keyboard nice soft touch feel easy to read letters touch pad works well but the r l click is a bit loud dvd player works well usb 3 0 ports backup to a portable 3 0 drive is fast hdd comes pre partitioned with d ata for backups etc battery i get about 4 hours per charge esthetics i like the overall look with the faux aluminium but style taste is always an individual thing the 5th gen i3 intel hd5500 video full hd screen 802 11ac wireless and win10 factory installed are all positives windows 10 has worked well for me and hasn t been difficult to learn to use it loads to the desktop in about 20 seconds and shuts down fast because of the high resolution screen win10 was factory set to 125 which for many people with good eyes would be adaquate i prefer to use 150 and also adjust the font size larger than default the screen appears to be a tn type which is more sensitive to viewing angle however once i set the screen at the correct angle i don t find it to be a problem if you want a wide viewing angle buy a higher priced laptop with an ips screen after reading some of the negative reviews i have to say that i feel fortunate that my unit didn t experience any of the problems that some other people have had overall i m happy with my purchase i would have rated this 5 stars if the battery charge would last about 6 hours
