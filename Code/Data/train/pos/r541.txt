it s lightweight and responds well to touch commands but i hate windows os i returned this because i hate windows 10 and also 8 so much the stand part can dig into your legs after long periods and it s a little unwieldy to hold sound quality was pretty good and speed was great too although i only used it on wifi so who knows about 3 4g so basically if you dont mind windows operating systems go for it its a powerful laptop tablet for a good price
