pros powerful with gpu version ultra portable and light ability to detach screen cons graphics card 34 fails 34 every once in a while expecting a driver update to fix this soon it doesn t close flat see pictures full review recently i have begun a phd program in statistics i owned a 2012 macbook pro with retina display and it was doing the job quite well however it became annoying to have to log in to my university s server in order to use applications like mathematica matlab and sas also my battery at maybe 85 percent health was only lasting 5 6 hours each charge and i got tired of the bulkiness of carrying around a heavy 15 inch laptop so i went on the look for something less bulky with similar power and better battery life it was difficult to find because usually bigger laptops usually are more powerful than smaller ones due to more space and also have bigger batteries i looked over the microsoft site and saw the surface book it had everything i was looking for power portability and battery life i got 10 off by using the student discount google microsoft student discount and give your university s name after about a week of usage i am really falling in love with this laptop the detachable screen is a great feature if you just need to read for class then you can leave the keyboard behind but note that the keyboard supplies 75 of the batter capacity it s pretty great if you want to go to the gym for a light jog on the treadmill or elliptical machine while watching netflix i will update this review after the semester so i can get a good glimpse of student life with this laptop i expect to write good things
