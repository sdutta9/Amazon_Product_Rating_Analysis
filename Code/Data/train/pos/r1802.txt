i really like my new laptop the touch screen is great and the ability to make things larger for viewing ease is awesome the rotating screen allowing it to work like a tablet makes it easy for different applications the fast processor allows me to move quickly through different windows making my work easier this is my 3rd toshiba laptop and i like them for their dependability this one is the best for me so far
