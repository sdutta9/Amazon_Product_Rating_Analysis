this is a very nice tablet for the money i just can t figure out how to get it to save to sd card keeps saying no sd card also it is supposed to be a 16gb tablet and it only registers under 1gb and i didn t install or download anything yet i bought this for my mom who is legally blind it has a talk feature that is helpful to her the screen is incredibly crisp if i could figure out the storage issue i would give it 5 stars
