usually a three star review represents an average product this three star review represents half of a five star product and half of a one star product at the moment i feel like i have schrodinger s surface either it s going to be my primary computer for a few years or i m going to return it and curse microsoft s name it all depends on whether and how quickly microsoft fixes the various bugs that are currently part of the surface pro 4 experience first the positives if you ve played with the surface pro 3 you know that you can fry an egg on it after 15 minutes of use the surface pro 4 has fixed this which means it s actually viable as a tablet for an extended time the touch screen is very responsive this is my first touch screen computer and i m surprised how often i find myself reaching up and scrolling instead of using the keyboard s trackpad the pen is great it took me about a day to get used to writing with it my notes during the first day are irredeemable but since then i haven t picked up my paper notebook the pen shines best in onenote pdf annotation sp4 comes with an amazing app drawboard pdf and the art apps sp4 comes with freshpaint which is a joy the pen is also useful in other apps too i use it to select text in the browser and in documents and to extend calculations in excel the screen looks great windows 10 is a great step forward onenote is just really cool the keyboard is amazing next the negatives as shipped your battery will drain while the computer is asleep even quicker than when it s awake you can fix this by updating your battery driver but it s a problem out of box browsing certain sites causes the computer serious problems the screen will flash various colors and eventually blink out with an error message occasionally it will force the computer to restart edge the internet explorer replacement while buggy itself it refuses to load about one in every three sites is a lot worse on the surface for some reason i expected microsoft hardware to play nice with microsoft software but that hasn t been my experience so far i m so used to on screen keyboards reading my mind and appearing whenever i need to type surface or perhaps windows 10 has a long way to go in that department when i first started using the surface it would crash nearly every time the screen rotated this was fixed by an update the surface s screen resolution presents problems with a lot of non microsoft products and buttons will show up tiny the surface doesn t seem like to attach programs to the very top of the screen locking a program to the top leaves a centimeter or so of the desktop at the top even for office products the microphone seems to occasionally and randomly fail the camera didn t work out of box either you have to update in the windows store microsoft support my pen s eraser cursor no longer registers and i ve tried three separate times to troubleshoot it using microsoft s online support team the first time i think the guy used my question to go on break and after 20 minutes he had done little more than verify my account the last person had me go through all the troubleshooting steps then once that didn t work claimed that he scheduled a call with the resolutions team the call never came at this point i prefer a broken product over working with the support team overall it is a great piece of hardware windows 10 is a huge step forward and the office suite is unparalleled for productivity especially with onenote the hardware and software don t work together with all the bugs you will have to spend quite a bit of time just keeping your surface in working condition if you don t mind doing that you will eventually have a great computer and a very good tablet just don t get it for your tech novice relative
