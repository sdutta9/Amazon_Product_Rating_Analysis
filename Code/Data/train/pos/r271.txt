this is my first time buying in amazon since the school season is coming back now and lesson s learned i would never buy an expensive laptop online again it s confusing to return this laptop since i really need it for my school now the problem is that i bought this beautiful laptop because i need the stylus so that i could draw on the screen but what happen is there s a certain area on the screen that i couldn t draw on and most annoying is that it keeps on clicking by itself preventing me on writing peacefully without disturbed by this 34 ghost clicking 34 area that keeps on clicking every minutes i m going to check in to dell shop tomorrow i hope they could help me solve this issue i hope
