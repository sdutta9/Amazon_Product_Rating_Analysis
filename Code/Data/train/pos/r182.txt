i really love this tablet here are some pros and cons i have found i have had the surface 2 for about a month 1 the touch screen is very responsive better than some i have used 2 windows 8 1 rt is easy to use and easy to personalize i really like having the metro tiles start screen as well as a traditional desktop though i don 8217 t use the traditional desktop much 3 great for web surfing if there isn 8217 t an app for what i want to do i just use the browser 4 free microsoft office the full version no trial 5 good hardware lightweight full usb port rocker volume button and power button the kickstand with two positions makes it comfortable to use while at a desk on the lap laying down etc 6 the speakers and video quality are good this would be good for games and movies though i have really only used it with youtube and some free games from the app store 7 i have a canon printer and had no problems printing using the usb port wifi printing should also work fine 8 the battery is better than a traditional laptop i can get easily 6 to 8 hours of use depending on screen brightness using it nonstop versus turning it on and off actually seems to prolong battery life and it charges quickly cons 1 the on screen keyboard takes up a lot of the screen but it is still usable an external keyboard is great when typing long emails papers documents etc 2 the charge cord is rather short and the light doesn 8217 t change between charging and fully charged so i don 8217 t know when it is done without turning on the tablet to check the battery level 3 the tablet is very rectangular i don 8217 t mind but ipad users may have a problem with this it looks great as a laptop with an external keyboard though overall my complaints are minor i am a teacher and i love this tablet for work but also for play it does pretty much anything a laptop can do i purchased the type cover 2 to go with this and it is great it has moving keys like a regular keyboard the keys light up plus it closes to protect your tablet screen it makes this functional tablet that much more functional
