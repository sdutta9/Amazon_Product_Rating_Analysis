the most amazing ultrabook you ll ever spend on when i receive the package the box was nice and tidy everything looks professional as if i was buying an apple production made from dell the wire and the charger is very slim and bevel great design and i like it a lot the first impression was that this is such a sturdy laptop aluminum cover plate and round corner edge makes it slick and professional upon opening i was surprised about the keyboard and the trackpad the computer had some charge in it so that i didn t have to use the power until hours later the built in camera is actually at the bottom left corner on the monitor which makes it some noticeable concern since your hand will most likely block the camera view unless you hide your hand there is no ethernet ports but there are a power plug mini display port usb port i think it s 3 0 it s colored black a audio jack and a nice battery indicator button to show how much power you have left in the system without having to launch the computer on the left side on the right side of the computer there s a lock port i believe another usb and a sd card this computer even have a bluetooth built in i don t know when or how i ll utilize such bluetooth technology but it might be handy some day on the bottom of the ultrabook is a nice nameplate which can be flipped over to see the computer s pn and sn this makes it look professional on either side of the notebook without having to show the labels the fan aren t too loud or complicated but some noticeable heat will arise when using the ultrabook full loaded what really blew me away was the quality of this monitor and it s a touch screen combo 3200x1800 resolution although windows 10 upscale everything so that you can see it 34 normally 34 while it makes remote desktop procedure insanely difficult to see what you re doing on a 13 3 laptop is beyond any normal laptop as for the specs itself from what i was told only the hard drive can be swapped out but not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not memory sticks well intel core i5 5600u and 8 gb of rams should be able to handle most of the applications i ve run on a daily basis you just blew away my old toshiba portege s z835 ultrabook to a whole new generation of ultrabook be warn this computer is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not windows 10 pro it s currently a home edition short version if you carry this for mobility and presentation without the need of ethernet port and lots of cash go for it
