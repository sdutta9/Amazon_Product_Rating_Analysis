bought this mid 2014 at the time it had the best specs for the best price in the category and it is super fast and has a great screen way better than a cheap 10 inch tablet i bought the year before which had terrible screen resolution and a slow processor battery lasts much longer than the other one i had can t really say anything bad about this for what you are paying no idea why anyone on earth pays 500 to 1k for an ipad when you can buy this
