i just started using this a couple of weeks ago so i don t have any information regarding long term durability but i really like this computer for the large size screen it is relatively light compared to others i got it set up quickly and i figured out the windows 8 1 quickly after not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not having any previous experience with it it was easy to get the desktop in the order i wanted it and remove lots of the icons from programs i ll never use i wanted to use a laptop primarily as a portable computer to be able to project microscopic images to show middle school students both fixed slides and living microscopic organisms in small group discussions but got a higher end to allow for expanded use later it worked great with the microscope hook up so that we could all view the microscopic images at the same time to discuss in real time while watching the microorganisms swim by it was a real hit in the classroom i also like the option for touchscreen i found that i got used to it so fast that just within a couple of weeks i m reaching to touch the screen of my work computer which doesn t have the touchscreen capabilities i m glad i paid a little more for something a bit more than what i actually needed
