when i finally got a desktop for serious work and decided to replace my monolithic beast of a laptop with something a bit lighter i was in luck as the ipad air and surface 2 had just been released what to do well when it came down to it i got sucked in by the nice keyboard covers and multitasking of the surface 2 so i grudgingly shelled out the cash for the surface hoping i wouldn t regret it and want the ipad later turns out i can honestly say i have no desire to switch this tablet is good actually it s really good first the build quality is sublime the finish is positively fondle able yes i invented a term just to describe it the sintered magnesium allow has a wonderful macbook trackpad like feel and the fabric and soft plastic that covers the type cover also has a luxurious feel the kickstand pops out with a lovely car door feel and so far i have had no problems with it staying in position speaking of the keyboard cover the magnetic attachment is really solid in fact you can easily hang the tablet from it the bezel is just the right width to allow your thumbs to rest without interfering with the touchscreen as well an the smooth edge to edge glass feels great now i ll say that the interface takes a little getting used to but once you do it s quite fast and fluid whether you re changing settings switching between apps or snapping two apps beside each other that brings me to my favorite feature on windows 8 1 rt multitasking i have no idea how people on ios and android live without this on a tablet but i m glad i don t it s incredibly nice to have your email open right next to facebook or your browser right next to ms word it just makes things so much faster and more fluid that being said not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not all apps seem to take kindly to this yet and it takes a little while to get a feel for the maximum amount you can change the proportion between apps before one of the leaves the screen by accident switching between different apps and workspaces panes of two or more apps is pretty fluid but i wish that the response time to edge gestures was a little better a minor complaint battery life is a bit tricky i ve heard reviews state as little as 5 hours for moderate usage and as much as 14 hours for playing video that being said in my personal experience i ve gotten 13 14 hours of moderate usage out of mine without any trouble if you re planning on keeping the brightness at 100 or watching back to back movies i can t really say what your experience will be like for me well let s just say i could have kept the charger at home as far as peripherals go and ports go the surface 2 turned out to be quite good and better than anything else i tried out the micro sd slot is very handy and adds up to an extra 64gb of storage for only about 50 dollars if you get one of the better micro sd cards on amazon the full sized usb 3 0 port is also a welcome addition although i haven t used it a lot yet also the headphone jack is quite powerful easily powering my 300ohm headphones at full volume i haven t yet had occasion to try the video out port so i can t really comment on that this brings us to my favorite hardware feature of the surface 2 the type cover 2 now i realize this review is for the surface 2 alone but it s worth mentioning this as it s an exclusive to the surface and i wouldn t own one without it for the sake of brevity i ll just say it rocks i actually prefer it to my full sized logitech keyboard because of the quick action and well proportioned key spacing after a little bit of practice you ll be typing as fast as on a real keyboard probably because it is a real keyboard now there are a few issues i ve had with the tablet first i did once have to restart it after things started lagging pretty badly it hasn t happened since so i m hoping it s fixed second when i was skyping on it for a number of hours 3 4 it became quite warm and began dimming the screen i ll have to keep using it to determine whether it s a defect and i have to return it a software issue or just a one off i ll update here when i find out it s also just a tad slower at opening apps than i would like and by a tad i really mean a tad this thing is very zippy in general lastly the app store is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not incredibly inviting at the moment there are a lot of crap apps and it s hard to sort the wheat from the chaff in the way they have it laid out now it doesn t bother me much as they still have pretty much anything i need it just takes a little longer to find it and if you don t think windows 8 has great apps check out fl studio it s really a good example of a fantastic metro app all in all i m quite happy with my decision to go with the surface 2 over the ipad air it fits my needs very well it works great in your lap if you re sitting on a bus on your desk if you re at work or in your lap as a tablet at home there are still a few rough edges such as the quite bare app store in windows 8 1 rt so i can t say it s a perfect experience but at the same time it s something fairly paradigm breaking for tablets so i understand and accept it nothing i ve found so far has been anything more than a minor annoyance if there s one word i would use to describe it it would be versatile i find it odd that some reviews i ve read take this as evidence of the surface 2 s schizophrenia stuck between products so to speak for a tablet that does everything that it does as well as it does it s a price i ll gladly pay
