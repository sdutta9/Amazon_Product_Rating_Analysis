this is my first laptop ever iv e had it for almost a week now and use it daily i am pretty pleased with the speed of it and the features the touch screen is nice i have burned a music cd with it too and it was rather fast and worked perfectly my only complaint and the reason i gave it four stars instead of five is because i like to lay in bed and do things online like write this review and it would be nice to have a backlit keyboard i am a decent typer however when the lights are out and im looking for a symbol or something i don t use all the time it can be a bit of a pain
