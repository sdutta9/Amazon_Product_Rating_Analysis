after using this microsoft tablet for a couple of weeks i am completely convinced that this is the best tablet out there if you spend more than a couple of hours everyday in microsoft office sean ong has a great review here on amazon showing the power of surface 2 and i recommend watching it two freebies which stood out for me apart from the window stacking microsoft office remote desktop capabilities are one year of skype unlimited world subscription living in australia and making a lot of calls to us i always bought this anyway i used to pay 45 every quarter for unlimited calls to us 8211 so that was immediately a saving of 180 for me 2 years of 200 gb free with skydrive this means 200 of free storage for two years after that i will have to either pay or download and dump it else where i currently have a dropbox subscription but its 199 20 per year skydrive is almost half the cost so there is a big chance i 8217 ll probably just end up using skydrive storage
