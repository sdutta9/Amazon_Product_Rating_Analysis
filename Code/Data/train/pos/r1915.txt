i had the touch screen version in my cart thought about it for a few days before hitting the commit button and somehow the no touch version is what i bought my mistake for sure i can t see why anyone wouldn t pay the extra 50 for the touch screen version the computer itself is ok it s big and bulky the keyboard is very nice keys have a nice feel you can t open a single office doc without purchasing or leasing the app office which i think is bs word or excel docs won t open in any type of reader i think that s kind of crappy don t know if that s a stripped down software issue from dell i knew i wasn t getting a lot of bells whistles at this price or a microsoft deal either way it sucks i bought this to run quickbooks for a business and web use hopefully it will be durable definitely get the touch screen version if you re considering one and research what software is on it
