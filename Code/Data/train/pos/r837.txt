its a pretty good computer honestly not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the fastest or best looking screen but it will be good for anyone its a little bit above average in terms of performance and that s me being generous its a little on the heavy side so watch for that other than that its a good computer for games on medium to low setting other than that its fast opens up applications in second doesn t freeze or hangs really pleasant computer also windows 8 goes way better with the touchscreen display and the backlit keyboard is a major plus
