pulling the laptop out of the box and you first notice the beautiful aluminum finish the laptop is fairly heavy for me however i wont want to have to travel with it a lot because of the weight i got the 6gb ram on it and upgraded it to a 16gb ram before i powered it up for the first time i will be using mine most for photographs i use adobe lightroom and element 12 and definitely need something fast so far so good the touch screen is very nice and the gorilla glass makes viewing very nice i have just used the system for a while hopefully i will be able to say more after a while
