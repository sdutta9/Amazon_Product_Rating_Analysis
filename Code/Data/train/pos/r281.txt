i purchased the 7348 model with i7 5200u and the 500gb since then i upgraded to the 256gb ssd to take advantage the overall power of the laptop and was happy with the decision overall i like the laptop with some pros and cons to share i hope you might find them helpful in deciding whether this is the right laptop for you pros 1 fan is whisper quiet 2 touch screen is bright and 34 calibratable 34 3 price is very reasonable 4 a lenovo yoga like 2 in 1 360 deg display rotation 4 full size hdmi port 5 2 usb 3 0 and 1 usb ports cons 1 the battery life of about 5 hours is reasonable but i was hoping for 7 hours 2 there was no touchpad driver available as the 34 cursor jumping 34 issue is very noticeable after installing all the latest drivers it was still a problem finally dell tech support helped to narrow down to the sensitivity issue which can be adjusted under 34 device touchpad 34 this was an annoying issue 3 i wished that this laptop is slotted for msata to reduce more weight as 3 6 lbs can still be a bit too heavy for frequent traveler 4 the bottom can get a bit warm while sitting on my legs overall it is a good quality laptop with inexpensive components materials look into lenovo yoga3 or aspire v7 if you want a step up
