this is a fantastic device it may not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not be 1080p but i don t need that kind of resolution for a laptop oh and having a touch screen is a definite plus i only take one star off due to its 34 picky 34 viewing angles to get the best out of your display you ll have to have the screen facing you directly good luck if you want to watch a movie with friends on either side of you as they will only see really washed out colors or an image that s too dark take note that even for a 15 6 34 this laptop is hefty due to the fact that it s made of aluminum it might be a bit heavy for some but it s negligible in my case from pressing the power button to navigating the desktop you re up and running in less than 30 seconds i might consider upgrading to an ssd in the future to further to shave off 20 more seconds this thing is speedy nonetheless the integrated intel hd 4400 gpu is good for most last gen things i can run games like 34 life is strange 34 34 battlefield 4 34 and 34 titanfall 34 on low or medium with 20 30fps on similar settings this laptop can run things like cs go anywhere between 55 75fps average that s all i ve tried on this machine at the time of this review will update later
