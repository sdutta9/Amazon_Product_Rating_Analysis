love my dell inspiron had an internal problem with the first one and sent it back for a refund i since purchased a new one love the back lit keyboard and photo 34 password 34 features just two less enthusiastic shortcomings 1 windows 8 1 is much more awkward to use compared to win 7 still have difficulty in transferring programs from old computer to new very disappointing 2 this inspiron model doesn t have a dvd which i previously knew purchased an external dvd but unable to run any movies or install new programs yet still tracking down the solution can t fault dell though
