purchased this laptop last year for my wife buying another for my son who uses the wife s all the time it is a good basic lightweight touch screen windows laptop that can handle most everyday activities my younger son even has steam downloaded on it and can play many games without complaint but of course he still wants a gaming pc i plan to purchase an ssd and swap out the hdd there are videos on youtube that show how to open an x200 laptop which is the same chassis as this laptop
