i was a little uncertain about getting a core i5 machine versus a core i7 but some reviews showed both processors being very close in throughput this laptop is priced well below any dell with a core i7 speed seems very fast installing programs from the built in cd rom takes little time even with large programs like photoshop the touchscreen works better than any i ve used before likely because it s capacitive versus the older optical technology mouse is easy to use keyboard feel is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not quite what i d like but it s as good as i ve found at this price point screen is bright clear sharp display isn t 1080p but is more than adequate for business uses some gaming youtube photoshop editing etc to say that i m pleased is an understatement
