very disappointed its my own fault i didn t research it well before buying it i was looking for something light weight and like a laptop so i could work anywhere i could get internet i didn t know how extremely limiting windows rt was you can only use the apps they provide which so many of the popular ones used aren t available i can t use it for work bc i need citrix and the app doesn t work when i looked it up everyone complains about the same thing so honestly it was a huge waste of money for what i would use it for i can t even just give it to my son bc the games that he plays aren t available i m hoping i can look into trading it in and going for a newer version that allows full function of windows and you can get the programs and apps that so many people use and be able to work i left it sitting there unused for so long i didn t realize my return time had passed so i m stuck with it and will take a loss in money
