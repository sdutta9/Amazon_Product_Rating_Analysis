completely fails as a tablet in my opinion app store is terrible crashes constantly autocorrect is insanely annoying on this device which makes writing papers or using word documents tiresome and inconvenient i have had the surface 2 since august of 2014 and the device is about to give out in my high school we were required to use the ipad 2 and it blows the surface 2 out of the water even being an outdated product this was the first tablet i ever bought for personal use i took extraordinarily good care of it and i can assure you i will never purchase anything from microsoft again the extra hundred dollars for an ipad or another brand that i haven t tried yet is well worth it
