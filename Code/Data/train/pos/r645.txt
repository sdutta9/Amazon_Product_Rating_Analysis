this computer is bad if you had purchased it for the the 349 price tag after that i would say your paying way to much for this laptop the battery life sucks but hey this is one of the few laptops that is actually 1080p which is very nice there are ups and downs with the laptop but you get what you pay for and for the price tag of 349 cant beat it
