amazing laptop for the price i had to mess around with the software because one time it shut down before the updates were complete and it rendered the keyboard and software useless for a while i called dell and all they kept saying was to turn it off and back on then they finally said send it in for repairs when it was only 24 hours old i just googled the problems i was having and fixed it on my own without needing a replacement 10 14 days from dell or send it in for repairs 7 10 days from dell i give the laptop a 5 star rating and dell a 1 star rating on their useless tech support the laptop has decent battery life of around 4 hours mixed use and it s very slim and it doesn t even feel around 6 pounds while carrying it only when lifting it i can play garry s mod and team fortress 2 on medium to high settings and planet side 2 on low settings decent graphics for an intel integrated chip oh and the touchscreen is wonderful just make sure to always let windows update finish completely before letting it shut down then you won t have to waste 4 hours of your life on the phone with dell
