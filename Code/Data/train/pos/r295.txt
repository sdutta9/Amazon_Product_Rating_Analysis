i was interested in a surface pro 3 primarily for its portability but also its capability as a full pc this is about half the price if not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not less than a similarly equipped surface and is very portable and does everything i need it to if you have a priority on portability but still want to retain some performance then i think this should be on your list of candidates if you re looking for a caselogic sleeve case i had to get the 14 34 case because the 13 3 34 case was too small it won t be a gaming power house but for work it has been great i haven t had a lot of laptops but the touchpad on this one has been the best i ve ever used normally turning off the touchpad is the first thing i do but i ve been using it without a mouse since i got it also the packaging is very clean the case has one sticker next to the keyboard for the intel processor and the only other tag on it is the dell logo the material of the case looks really clean and feels good to the touch too i like the quality of the display one item to mention in the display department is that i noticed the windows settings are set to enlarge text and windows if you turn this off everything gets too small to easily read with it on some applications don t play well with it for example some dialogs in sql management studio 2014 like the one for browsing for a backup displays things oddly spaced trees are squished to the point where they are unreadable etc i haven t tried any other resolutions the fan can get pretty noisy and the exhaust out the back appears to get slightly blocked by the screen when it is opened to around 90 degrees so i imaging it isn t getting great airflow the type of sound it produces is a high pitched whirring luckily it doesn t sound like a grinder it doesn t bother me but some might find it annoying when it is going full blast if they were looking for something that won t make any noise the speakers have no bass whatsoever but i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not picky when it comes to audio and it isn t primarily for entertainment so it wasn t a factor in my purchasing decision if you want to listen to some music or watch a movie on it you are going to have to have lowered expectations in the audio department the keyboard can take some getting used to there is a function key for accessing page up page down home and end which are tied to the arrow keys now that i m used to it i don t have to think about it so i haven t noticed it slowing me down any i m pleased with the tactile response on the keys so i don t have any complaints there i read some reviews that mentioned issues with the touch screen malfunctioning but i haven t experienced this problem i like the fact it has touch screen capabilities but i haven t been using it that way so maybe that issue comes up as you use it
