i have had this computer for about 2 months after my old dell xps studio 17 overheated this is touchless with windows 8 1 an i5 processor and 4 gb of ram pros excellent battery life i usually run it on powersaver for a solid 7 to 10 hours of use at a time great resolution videos and graphics in general look crisp portability lightweight small and thin easy to carry one handed comfortable on lap heat excellent heat distribution rarely gets excessively hot and when it does its fans are quiet and unobtrusive keyboard good feel and spacing despite small and shallow buttons easy to clean backlight is very useful sound have had no problems listening to and editing music after a small moment of the sound source stopping a distinct sound of the sound driver can be heard but you can get used to it cons poor trackpad lacks real buttons hard to do the windows mouse movement shortcuts and commands for simple right clicks are finicky let alone scrolling after moderate use the trackpad will glitch out as though it is on permanent hold down which cannot be fixed without a restart simply cursor movement is fine but that s it highly recommend getting a mouse the graphics card driver can freeze during moderate level video usage such as internet streams or extended movies and may require refreshing though it recovers quickly some graphic glitches remain when having multiple windows open due to recent change from flash to html on sites like youtube this may no longer be true however lowish processing power can t really handle high end processing stress tested with research programs matlab and casino slows down with google drive handles microsoft office programs with no issue haven t had time to check with dell for possible tech support but heard their customer service there wasn t very good this ultrabook is great as a personal computer for casual use and business but in retrospect i may have wanted higher specs across the board with the processor ram and memory to assist at some of the higher tech jobs i wish to do
