terrible laptop it is the worst i have ever purchased i m writing this review from my trusty 3 5 year old samsung series 9 because the dell xps 13 is currently rebooting from its second crash in a twelve hour period the xps 13 is a gorgeous machine that i owned for about ten days during that time it froze once or twice daily and i would have to hold the power key until shutdown was forced in order to restart the computer i must say it always did a good job of recovering my data the battery life after charging all night and reaching 100 would only last for 4 5 hours that s nowhere close to the fifteen hours advertised right out of box there were 107 important updates pending that repeatedly failed to install over the course of the the 10 day period there was also an optional windows 10 update that also failed to install at least four times i ve already initiated the return process and will be shipping the dell xps 13 back pronto i m still on the hunt to purchase another ultrabook but it will not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not be a dell
