this is my second dell latitude d630 i chose to buy another one because it is one tough laptop the first one suffered hard use and kept on working it looks like it went through a war still works by the way but i needed a second laptop for work so i just got another one i chose a like new refurbished previously owned one for it s great price tag but when it arrived it looked totally unused and works perfectly love the screen no reflections from bright light or sun same as the old one i think the old one will be my streaming movie entertainment center i know it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not as fast as the new ones but it s a duo core and it is plenty fast runs windows 7 and i have nothing bad to say about this laptop what so ever
