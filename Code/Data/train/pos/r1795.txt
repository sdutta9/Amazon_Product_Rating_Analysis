very pleased with this laptop i needed it just for school and work i choose this laptop for the following reasons happy with prior toshiba products 4gb of ram 64bit full version of window more laptop than tablet but you can fold into a laptop what i didn t like lots of bloatware i had to install a ssd myself and it was not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not easy installed a fresh copy of windows to get rid of the bloatware and had to reinstall a lot of drivers the outcome was worth it runs so much quicker boot time is less than 5 seconds and apps open up almost instantly so buy this model grab a 128 gb ssd and you have a great light all in one
