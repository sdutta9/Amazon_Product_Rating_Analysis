for the money this laptop feels sturdy and has decent pep for the price it has enough ram and disk space to meet the needs of normal users and has some impressive features like the touchscreen backlit keyboard i5 processor and styling that eerily resembles a macbook pro the unit comes with windows 8 1 and i immediately upgrade to windows 10 nothing about this laptop felt cheap although i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a huge fan of the color matched keyboard but that s just personal preference i purchased this product for a family member that has basic computer skills but likes laptops if i had the money on hand this unit would have received an ssd upgrade right away but i ll do that down the road and i know the performance will increase quite a bit the resolution on most of the 15 34 laptops that are reasonably affordable these days is 1368px it would have been nicer to have some more real estate on the desktop but this will be fine in this case i would definitely recommend this laptop for the price
