this was my first time ever purchasing a refurbished 34 laptop online and while i did experience some issues with connection the people at lantek were very supportive and helpful i would like to say thank you to eric lisa and lisa in reception for all the hard work and effort they put in to make it right i love my replacement and would recommend working with them to anyone looking for a great deal on a used refurbished laptop most sincerely elizabeth craig
