after having owned all versions of the ipad except obviously the ipad air which is about to come out and the original surface i have to say that the surface 2 is probably the best tablet i ve owned first off i had the ipad 3 and then the surface rt came out i bought the rt and wanted to love it so much but it had a few too many things against it windows rt was new and fresh at that point so the app selection was still pretty bare and some of the core apps didn t have the refinements they needed to be as functionally useful as they needed to be xbox music for instance i loved the feel and look of the device and it was quite durable but one big issue that i found was that the speakers were simply too quiet they had been subsequently enhanced through updates but i m speaking from owning the device for the first 2 3 months of it s life and the biggest problem of them all was that it was simply too slow the tegra 3 made running some of the windows rt apps simply not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not enjoyable and it took a bit too long to do simple things like opening up the apps navigating through them and even composing word documents and such on the desktop side of things well a year later and the surface 2 addresses all of this it comes with a 2 stage kickstand that definitely helps with it s stability in resting in your lap or visibility when looking at the device form different viewing angles the device now has a tegra 4 which windows rt just flies on i ve seen some intensive apps such as six guns a game have a little sluggishness to them but for the most part any app that you run will run and run well it nows runs windows 8 1 rt which has a number of enhancements over the previous version that make it much more feature complete and usable the device itself is lighter and slimmer and although i thought i wouldn t particularly care for the change from the black finish to the silver finish on the back of the device it looks good especially with the cyan type cover the screen is better on the device and is now the same as the surface pro 2 which makes reading and watching media as crisp and clear as ever it really is fantastic quality the new touch and type covers have been improved in many ways over their original incarnations with the most noticeable of them being that both the new keyboards are now backlit it s a great addition although if you have either of the original covers they will work just fine with the device personally i went with a type cover 2 as it has the tactile feedback from the keys that i need to really be effective at typing the touch cover didn t really give me that but they have increased the number of sensors on the touch cover so i d advice going to a microsoft store or getting your hands on one through other means to try them both and see what suits you best the few issues that i have with the device revolve around the fact that i still believe that the speakers could have a bit more volume and a bit more bass but they do seem to be a tad louder than what i remember the surface rt or surface 1 as they now call it to be the app selection has gotten a whole lot better but there are still a few that i d like to have that aren t available and i wish there were more big name game developers that would port their apps over to the windows store i m specifically thinking about developers such as telltale who made the walking dead game when it comes down to it why do i believe that its better than an ipad well internet explorer is great and it is flash compatible which helps on some websites that i need to be able to access and use for instance when using wolfram applications on the web to do my homework it is compact and the keyboard covers are great at being able to get light work done whether in word powerpoint or excel but by far the ability to snap two apps to your screen have two apps running at once while being able to adjust how much of the screen they take up if one is more necessary than another is the greatest advantage of them all while you can have apps running in the background on your ipad which is fine the ability to use two apps at once to have two webpages going at once to be growing the web on one side of things but on the other side have another app running such as a video player the music app or anything else you want is simply efficient and immensely useful in getting stuff done the ipad to me is a great consumption device but an okay productivity device i will give it that app makers have built around it s deficiencies to make it a lot more productive than it inherently is by just having a screen with a surface 2 and either one of the keyboards which simply cannot exist without one another figuratively speaking though it cannot be understated that the widescreen display though it can be an adjustment to make if you ve had an ipad makes it great for viewing media and the keyboard ability to use two apps at once on the screen make productivity much more inherent to the device if you re able to see the device for what it is which is a great tablet with the potential for great productivity and believe in the ability for the windows store s app selection to grow though it s pretty decent now then this is definitely the device for you if you need to be on the cutting edge of getting all the latest and greatest apps out right now then although i d like to say you should still get a surface the ipad simply can t be beat in terms of developer support right now
