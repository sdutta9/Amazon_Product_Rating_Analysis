when i got the computer i already loved it the the screen kept on touching its self made me mad but i found out it was just static electricity so i rubbed my super fuzzy blanket over it the wiped down with wet cloth and its been a week but the problem stopped it but its a light small computer easy for transport touchscreen works great speakers are clear and loud
