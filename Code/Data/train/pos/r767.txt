i have just received my dell laptop from amazon via dhl the packing was nice and neat unlike ups dhl is always on time even though i have only spent a few hours on this laptop i found that the build quality of this laptop is above average for a mid range laptop especially the cover is of aluminum the backlit keyboard is an excellent feature the touchscreen is a nice additives for the upcoming windows 10 the machine is quiet in general the speed is good for a laptop of this range all in all this laptop looks and woks great no problem with the touchpad i will update this review if anything new pops up thank you amazon for the excellent service
