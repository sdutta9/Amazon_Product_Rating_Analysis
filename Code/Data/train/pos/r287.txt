update 10 8 15 i recently upgraded to windows 10 free upgrade on this computer without any problems windows 10 is a major improvement over windows 8 and it makes the combination of touch screen keyboard mouse navigation of this laptop even easier to use two thumbs up this is a cool convertible laptop from dell that sports all the latest components a core i7 processor a 256 gb ssd and a beautiful 13 3 in ips screen with vivid colors and touch sensitivity the design is attractive with an all aluminum chassis that looks similar to a macbook air when closed the lid opens up on two sturdy hinges and folds back all the way so that you can use it as a tablet there is a full size chiclet style keyboard that is reasonably spaced typing on it feels pretty good although key movement is a little shallow for my tastes the best part of the laptop is the hd screen it is bright even when outdoors although the glossy screen can be a problem in direct sunlight and it s great to watch movies on one design issue there is a pretty large bezel around the screen i e the screen doesn t go all the way to the edges this is a mixed blessing because it s unused space and makes the laptop bigger than it needs to be but it also gives a place to grip the laptop with when you hold it in tablet mode performance feels very zippy with the ssd and i7 processor battery life is quite good also lasted 8 hours with normal use fan noise was noticeable while watching a movie but thankfully it didn t kick in too often although the laptop worked fine in tablet mode it s too heavy to hold in one arm for long periods of time at 3 6 lbs you ll never forget that you re not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not holding an ipad there is a nice passive stylus that is stored in the laptop itself overall this is a high quality convertible laptop that while a little too big and heavy for prolonged use as a tablet is great to have as an all around portable computer
