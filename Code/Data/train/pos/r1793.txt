i bought this computer after looking for a 2 in 1 convertible for several weeks i was originally going to buy the asus flip 14 34 which was on sale at best buy but missed the sale and then went and found this one for sale at first i thought wow this is small my old computer was also a toshiba but it was a 15 6 34 and as a teacher i use the number pad often so i didn t think i could adjust to the smaller screen well i adjusted pretty quickly it s pretty light and compact enough to carry around and great to use in tablet mode i wish it fir a little more flush with the bottom though but its still pretty thin it s just so much lighter than my old computer so those who have a tablet may find it heavier but for me it s super light the keypad took a little getting used to because the keyboard is smaller but the keys are so responsive i have a windows phone and thought i wouldn t mind the windows 8 1 but i was wrong i really don t like the non start button and it s preloaded with so much stuff i ve had the computer two weeks and i m still finding things to delete because my previous computer was already 6 years old with windows vista this computer is like a whole new world i didn t really think i would love it so much at first i thought i wouldn t use more than the tablet and laptop mode but i have use it in 34 presentation 34 mode and 34 tent 34 mode and found that i can never go back to a conventional laptop i love this computer so much i got my brother to by one just a few days ago he loves it too if you are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a gamer and are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not using it for heavy programming this little computer id great as a teacher who needs a computer at work at home and during continuing education classes this is a great computer to tote around wherever you go and the versatility is fantastic you just can t beat the price for everything you get with this little gem it s plastic on the outside but has an aluminum keyboard in a gold color that makes it look beautiful the plastic on the outside does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not make it look cheap the finish makes it look more expensive than it is i can t say enough i love this computer
