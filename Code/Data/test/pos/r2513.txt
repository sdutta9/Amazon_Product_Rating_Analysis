i ve had mine for about 6 months now and still can t believe how versatile it is it s like a huge swiss army knife with a tool for everything and doesn t leave me feeling like the tool pros can be placed in any position screen rotation windows button o that s an oh not not_not a zero keyboard is rather hard and doesn t flex like other laptops i ve had fast yes i said it fast i use chunky music software on it and it does fine while downloading linux hehe bye windows touch screen works well but like most touch screens be careful with drag and drop especially in list view takes a beating i know i m rough on just about everything i own hinges on screen are tough maybe a little stiff so i put wd40 on them jk don t do that beats audio a bit better than i thought it d be and the app allows you to tweak the sound to your liking large solid state drive for bigger applications doesn t get hot like many of the other notebook laptop thingies i ve owned cons people might think it s an alternative to a tablet if that s what you want buy one of those this ain t a tablet at 4 lbs comes with bloatwares like mcafee making it take longer to personalize and slows down the machine the only physical problem with it is the viewing angle of the screen is kinda small and you will not not_not see it s on if the sun is out i really have beat on it even played mechanic under an f250 for a week with it in tablet mode yeah the screen cleans up if there are any cons why give it 5 stars look at the price
