i purchased this laptop because i wanted a new pc that did not not_not have windows 10 installed on it i have used pcs and laptops since the 1980 s and found microsoft s three best operating systems to be windows 98 windows xp and windows 7 vista and windows 8 were imho disasters the 34 free 34 upgrade to windows 10 is available but i would do some very serious research before accepting the electronic agreement for it s use the pc itself is a reasonably good value for the price 4 gb of ram is a bit light for an operating system as sophisticated as windows 7 however the upgrade to 8 gb is only about 40 for the simm unfortunately there is only one memory slot so the only upgrade you can make to the memory is to install a single 8 gb module the disk drive is also easy to replace you can probably use a ssd however ssds of 500 gb or more are still quite expensive the display is fairly sharp but i have seen better contrast on higher end pcs the sound quality is reasonably good with its built in speakers but for more serious listening you will want to hook on a pair of amplified pc speakers the touch pad mouse works ok but a wireless mouse greatly increases ease of use the keyboard is very low and flat it is set way back and only fills about half the width of the pc the keys only move a fraction of an inch and are extremely sensitive to the touch i would recommend getting a wireless keyboard if you arre planning on using the keyboard for extensive typing or data entry overall i am pleased with this purchase power users and gamers may want to look at laptops with a faster processor and a higher contrast display but this laptop should be more than adequate for the needs of the average user
