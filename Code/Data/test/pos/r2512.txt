would do zero stars if i could i actually bought this from costco i returned it within 30 days the screen is really dark and even when you increase the lightness as far as it can go it is still dark the color is off muted i looked at my fb photos and they looked awful i don t know how to explain it exactly it is like a tv with a funky image except you can t adjust it the sound was low despite the beats audio and finally it is top heavy when using this as a laptop it feels like it will tip over and yet because the colors are off and the video is so dark when you put it in the other positions you can t see the images at all it doesn t have a backlit keyboard which you don t realize is important until you don t have it the processing is slow and the touchscreen is not not_not as responsive as you would expect and or like
