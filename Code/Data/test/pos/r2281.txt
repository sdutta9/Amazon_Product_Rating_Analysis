i bought two of these one for a high school student and one for myself we needed basic machines and these didn t even qualify for those low expectations the were both completely unusable in under six months time one had a manufacturer defect in the power cord whose unstable power had fried the motherboard and the other had a screen that quit if i didn t live in palau i may have taken the issue up with dell but no such luck i will never buy another dell
