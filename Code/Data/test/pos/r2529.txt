beautiful machine that works perfectly i was particularly impressed that other than mcafee there was no garbage installed i easily removed mcafee and was ready to go i purchased this machine as a backup to my terrific dell desktop and was so thankgul to still be able to purchase a windows 7 machine my two now run seamlessly together very satisfied with my purchase
