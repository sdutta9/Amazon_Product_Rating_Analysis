not not_not what i expected at this price point i upgraded from a four year old toshiba that cost me around 300 this isn t much faster and the touch pad has been problematic from day 1 a left click registers as a right click about 90 of the time i definitely wouldn t order this laptop again if i hadn t already spent so much time installing software i probably would have returned it this will be my last dell
