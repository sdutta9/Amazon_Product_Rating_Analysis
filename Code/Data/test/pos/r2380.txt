i received this as a gift in 11 2014 and the laptop has pretty much broken down piece by piece since that time first the mousepad stop working and i had to buy a usb mouse then the battery stopped charging completey and i have to keep it plugged in all the time these two issues came up within 4 months of owning the laptop the computer now takes 10 mintues to load anything a web page a word program etc finally the hard drive has failed and its out of the small warrenty time frame so i m stuck with a grey square piece of plastic it didn t even make it for a year i ve owned dell laptops before and never had these issues with their products very disappointed
