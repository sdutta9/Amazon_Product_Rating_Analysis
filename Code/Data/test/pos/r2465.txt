this laptop is great when it first comes out of the box but it has already crapped out on us twice hp customer service is impossible to reach i mean 34 literally 34 impossible to reach if you get through you must know someone who works at hp amazon was very helpful in getting the problem fixed the first time we made a good choice by getting squaretrade square trade replaced it for us the second time this machine crapped out the only reason this machine has not not_not broken a third time is because we stopped using it and upgraded to mac don t get this this is garbage
