not not_not great but not not_not awful either i picked this computer after shopping at a computer super center and needing to buy a new computer after my macbook pro died a horrible death this happened to be in my price range and had some of not not_not all of the features i was looking for the two biggest things that stand out to me are the display and sound quality the screen is average the colours do look very washed out most of the time and i find myself reaching for my samsung tablet to do a little online shopping instead of opening my computer right up the volume isn t all that great i m usually listening to things at 50 volume or greater when i m at home with other things happening in the background and even my phone motorola x 1 has better overall sound quality than this computer ni don t find myself playing with it in tent mode at all and i ve used it in tablet mode once i like it in stand mode if i m feeling more hands on but am doing more than my tablet can handle but overall i just use it in laptop mode i m used to keyboards with predictive text now something the on screen keyboard is distinctly lacking so i try to avoid using the touch keyboard i did go out and buy an actual mouse right away because the trackpad can lag some especially with two finger scrolling which has become fairly essential to me as i spend a lot of time on endless scrolling websites nbottom line is that this computer is just middle of the road which is what i ve come to expect from hp the outside is nice but the inside is somewhat dull both literally and metaphorically
