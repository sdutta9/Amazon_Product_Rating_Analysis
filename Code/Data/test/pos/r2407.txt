after much research and reading reviews on different sites here pc mag laptop mag and the likes i almost settled on buying this older model of inspiron until i went on dell s site and discovered that the newer out mid next week i7 5500u chipped inspiron is much more desirable what with the sales on there dell sells the higher end of that machine with a whooping discount offering a better deal than this older model on top of that dell wisely in my opinion will install windows 7 pro before shipping it i m hoping to give that new machine a 4 star or even 5 if i really like it i should get it in two weeks time and will update this review in hopeful comparison new chip windows 7 pro and the newly gone private dell hopefully better management therefore better long visioned engineering i gave this older model a 3 star
