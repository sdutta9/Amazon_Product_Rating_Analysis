right after going through the installation and setup process i attempted to install my first piece of required software and quickly discovered that the promise of a 34 windows 34 tablet was actually a joke the near worthless half crippled 34 tablet 34 version of windows 8 1 makes this a very expensive and poor competitor to every other android tablet on the market i have since learned that microsoft is no longer making these and their newer ones have 34 real 34 windows so they seem to have learned their lesson but buyer beware if you are expecting a tablet that can run your windows programs you are going to be very disappointed if you purchase the surface 2 the only reason that i gave two stars and not not_not one was that the responsiveness and ease of use of the device make it fine if the limited software is all you require crippled versions of ms office are included so you can save some money there
