mind bogglingly slow constant interruptions from non uninstallable mcafee software want to reboot hope you have half an hour to spare i get that it s only 2gb ram but if it can t be optimized to run 8 1 and say one other program why try swipe the trackpad wait 3 seconds the pointer moves then it has to think about where the cursor is for another 30 seconds before you can say add input of one char then wait then you can enter maybe 3 or 4 more want to watch a video ha hahaha looking for ways to optimize but not not_not finding much will likely return it 1 star for this abomination only adding the second for on time delivery i think the seller means well but man test your product
