i ve had mine for about 6 months now and still can t believe how versatile it is it s like a huge swiss army knife with a tool for everything and doesn t leave me feeling like the tool npros ncan be placed in any position screen rotation windows button o that s an oh not not_not a zero nkeyboard is rather hard and doesn t flex like other laptops i ve had nfast yes i said it fast i use chunky music software on it and it does fine while downloading linux hehe bye windows ntouch screen works well but like most touch screens be careful with drag and drop especially in list view ntakes a beating i know i m rough on just about everything i own nhinges on screen are tough maybe a little stiff so i put wd40 on them jk don t do that nbeats audio a bit better than i thought it d be and the app allows you to tweak the sound to your liking nlarge solid state drive for bigger applications ndoesn t get hot like many of the other notebook laptop thingies i ve owned ncons npeople might think it s an alternative to a tablet if that s what you want buy one of those this ain t a tablet at 4 lbs ncomes with bloatwares like mcafee making it take longer to personalize and slows down the machine nthe only physical problem with it is the viewing angle of the screen is kinda small and you will not not_not see it s on if the sun is out ni really have beat on it even played mechanic under an f250 for a week with it in tablet mode yeah the screen cleans up if there are any cons why give it 5 stars look at the price
