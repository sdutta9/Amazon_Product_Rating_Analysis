we re very impressed with this hp we bought this hp for our son since his school requires a laptop with 9 hours of battery life on a single charge wins n 9 hours of battery life so far charging each night results in a full school day s use n super responsive touch screen within a week he spills soda onto his keyboard rendering it mostly useless luckily the touch screen is so responsive he has been able to use the device without the keyboard we bought a usb silicone keyboard for the times when he might need to use the keyboard extensively like for writing essays n windows 10 which this model uses is amazing my son vocally prefers windows 10 over os x yosemite n its powerful enough to play minecraft and other internet heavy games nfails so far none nwe re very glad to have only paid half the cost of a macbook air for the same if not not_not better results we also have the full gamut of mac apple products macbook air pro ipads iphones etc we were sorely tempted to spend the extra money on the reliability of apple but only the top of the line macbook might have delivered a full day s charge based on 60 days of school use my son and our pocket books are happily surprised to be very pleased
