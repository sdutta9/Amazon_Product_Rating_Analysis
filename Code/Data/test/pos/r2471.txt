bought this at my local sam s club same processor but mine had 6gb of ram overall this was pretty much what i expected from a sub 600 convertible however the screen is absolutely terrible the viewing angles contrast brightness and colors are all unacceptable even for the price it is simply not not_not worth it ngreat idea and would have been satisfied if the screen was decent as it was i returned it after a week
