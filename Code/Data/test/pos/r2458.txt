very happy i do photography on the road and the 8 gb memory and quick processor speed have significantly reduced my work time the display is a very crisp hd and with the use of a calibrator i have excellent true colors took a little time to adjust to the wider keyboard with number pad comes with a dvd read write many of the newer laptops don t have them and you have to purchase a separate external unit does not not_not come with recovery media but has dell recovery app so you can make your own be sure to do it asap as others have mentioned to use the f keys you need to also hit the fn key there is a work around but it isn t that important to me packaging for shipping was more than adequate and laptop was well protected
