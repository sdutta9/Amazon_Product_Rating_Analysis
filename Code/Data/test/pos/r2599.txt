i am thrilled with this laptop the casing is plastic but still solid applications load quickly no delay on downloads wifi connection is strong the mouse track and keyboard are responsive the sound is crisp it runs quietly and stays relatively cool what i didn t expect is the display is touch screen i love that with an i3 core processor 8 gb of ram tb of hard drive space an intel graphics hd card dvd burner hdmi ethernet and 3 usb ports i definitely received my money s worth i would recommend this laptop to both my family and friends
