hp x360 is a very confusing array of choices and hp s lack of detail and clarity are to blame this leads to alot of frustration trying to sort out their x360 models you have the pavilion models spectre models and envy etc but even within one model range you have various configurations of cpu screen etc in fact for the laptop on this screen the current amazon listing doesn t even have minimal specs for instance you cannot tell what the screen resolution is i later found out from laptopmag that it s 1366 x 768 for both 11 6 and 13 3 screens the 13 3 34 with 1366x768 is a pretty low pixel density hp needs to use varying model numbers letters or other clear identifiers in order to keep things sorted out otherwise customers will quickly be confused by all the offerings which may differ by only the cpu installed which makes a huge difference even on amazon some of hp x360 item numbers are either nonsensical having nothing to do with the specs of the unit m1x24ua aba or listings like this one that have no model number at all hp pavilion x360 2 in 1 13 3 inch touchscreen laptop intel core i3 5010u 4gb memory 500gb hdd webcam windows 8 1 silver only for some hp pavilion 13 s128nr x360 13 3 inch item model numbers 13 s128nr x360 or 13 s120nr x360 do you approach a measure of sanity in numbering it can be really hard to compare x360 to other laptops and even harder to compare x360 models to each other take this laptop for example newest model hp pavilion x360 2 in 1 convertible laptop 11 6 inch hd ips touch screen intel quad core pentium n3700 processor 4gb ram 500gb hdd windows 10 description socket fcbga1170 clockspeed 1 6 ghz turbo speed 2 4 ghz no of cores 4 max tdp 6 w other names intel r pentium r cpu n3700 1 60ghz cpu first seen on charts q2 2015 cpumark price

intel core i3 5010u 2 10ghz compare average cpu mark description clockspeed 2 1 ghz no of cores 2 2 logical cores per physical max tdp 15 w other names intel r core tm i3 5010u cpu 2 10ghz cpu first seen on charts q1 2015 cpumark price na overall rank 703 last price change na average cpu mark 3062 it s not not_not not not_really clear how this current amazon listing page for this product being reviewed is different from the others listed above this laptop here at amazon is asin b00x9kpskk the other two above are b00uvxjeus the other maybe identical 13 3 inch with core i3 5010u and b016d03s18 the 11 6 inch model you should always go to cpubenchmark net and enter the cpu of the laptop you are thinking about getting the trade offs all start based on how fast the cpu is and how much memory it has so the pentium n3540 in this model with a tdp of 7 5w is consuming half the max power of the other processor at 15w and the n3540 has a slightly faster clock speed and four cores instead of two but this does not not_not not not_tell the complete story the cpu mark for the n3560 shows it performs at 66 of the faster one and there is a tradeoff between overall cpu processing speed and battery life but it does not not_not not not_necessarily mean that you get 2x or even 1 3x the battery life of the core i3 5010u in the other laptop and because hp does not not_not not not_list battery life comparisons for various x360 models on their own website or on amazon you are left to continue sleuthing which is crazy in the era of big data analytics and the world at your fingertips via the internet laptopmag says this of another x360 sibling with a 2 17 ghz intel pentium n3520 processor 34 you won t get much use out of the hp pavilion x360 without a charger handy the notebook lasted 3 hours and 43 minutes on our battery test web surfing over wi fi at 100 nits this endurance falls short of the k200ma 5 23 yoga 2 11 5 19 and nb15t 4 07 which all failed to live up to the 7 45 category average 34 laptopmag says of an x360 i3 5010u 2nd model in comparison above 34 the pavilion x360 13t has pretty good staying power for its price this convertible lasted 6 hours and 56 minutes on the laptop mag battery test continuous web surfing over wi fi at 100 nits which is better than the tp300 6 12 and the inspiron 15 4 46 the hp also beat the budget 2 in 1 average 6 17 34 note that the model number of 34 x360 13t 34 does not not_not not not_appear anywhere in the hp amazon listing we are guessing we have a match based on the screen size and cpu techradar speaking of a newer x360 model says 34 users will also be able to configure the 11 6 inch hp pavilion x360 with a fanless intel core m chip for 499 about 334 au 646 which hp promises will deliver eight hours of battery life 34 i could not not_not not not_tell which x360 this is because none of the amazon hp x360 product listings say core m and the review did not not_not not not_refer to any x360 model number hp needs to be consistent in clearly distinguishing the features of the zoo of x360 offerings this is something that manufacturers like hp can no longer ignore a model number should include the main specs of the laptop otherwise you risk picking a laptop that does not not_not not not_meet your specific needs and the hp website is no better although you can see some model numbers there if you click on see all offers on the x360 page using either chrome or ie nothing happens but besides clearer product numbering and model naming hp and the entire industry need to come to a kind of truth in labeling when it comes to price and performance most product pages for laptops do not not_not not not_clearly talk about battery life if you can get talk time and standby time for every mobile phone you should be able to get some kind of standard battery and performance specs for computers and tablets in the photography world there is a cipa standard for battery life in cameras there needs to be a similar standard here for battery life for laptops tablets and phones and all manufacturers need to use it maybe something like perflife batterylifeatbenchmarksettings standardperformancebenchmark
