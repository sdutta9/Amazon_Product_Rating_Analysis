i hate this laptop here is why i have a blog when i am typing my palm swipes the touch pad and moves my cursor which means i will start writing somewhere else then when i want to be writing no matter how hard i try not not_not not not_to touch the mouse pad with my hand it makes no difference i have barely used this laptop and the letters on the keys are already starting to wear off and to add to the lousy experience the keys are not not_not not not_sensitive at all sometimes i have to press the key 2 3 times before it will register i type 45wpm and it throws off my momentum i am a writer and i bought this laptop for writing and doing programming nunless you don t have much money or you only check e mail or something i would pass on this laptop i will never buy this model again ever i wouldn t pay even 100 bucks for this laptop i hate it that much non the plus side the battery lasts a good 4 6 hours it has a sturdy construction i have dropped it a few times it has a good hinge system the laptop responds well enough in terms of performance it came with 8gb of ram which is plenty for me and it came with a 1tb hdd which i have only used about 200gb of noh the lcd panel is protected by a flimsy shell and that is not not_not not not_a good feature in a laptop
