great computer and is more productive with touch screen after getting used to windows 8 1 has many productivity features that i have not not_not not not_learned the full potential of yet only problem is mouse pad has probably 10 features not not_not not not_sure yet it does a ton of annoying things that annoy and take up most the ram i am sure there is a way to adjust the mouse settings touch screen is incredibly fast mouse does its own thing and uses up much of the ram secondly this computer has a great processor just a little on the downside for ram i have purchased a fast sd card for additional 20 and windows ready boost has been helping tremendously for word and adobe documents most likely going to put 8gb ram into it so i can utilize the full potential of the computer
