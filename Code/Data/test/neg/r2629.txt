love this product good quality and can t tell it was reconditioned only issue thus far is the sound perhaps this was the problem that was to be refurbished or overlooked in the process of refurbishment the volume of the speaker is low weak and hard to hear i have another surface so i know the difference when i plug in earphones ear buds the sound is normal and of adequate strength to further complicate the sound occasionally it raises to full volume and the control button has no affect in regulating the sound i have to restart and the problem goes away something is not not_not not not_right but not not_not not not_a deal killer as long i can continue to get the sound to work with ear phones
