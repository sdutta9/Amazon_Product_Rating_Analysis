it s all right as far as it goes but the windows 8 1 is not not_not not not_not not not_a fan but then i m an old bastard ready for the boneyard a younger person who is more in tune with today might really like this the hardware seems to be fine and they ve made the keyboard a little less prone to accidents really no such thing i something happens it is most likely due to someone making a mistake and it is the fault of the mistake maker i ve got vista on my other laptop and win7 on my desktop not not_not not not_a fan of any but really enjoyed the xp version of windows
