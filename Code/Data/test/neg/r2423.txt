there are alot of people in here complaining about the touchpad on this computer i just received min yesterday and began to set it up to my liking i did notice the touchpad was sluggish and difficult to use at first however once you go into the control panel you can adjust the sensitivity and speed of the pointer response from the touchpad after adjusting it i found it works quite well i still have to get used to the size but im sure it will come with time if i notice anything else ill post it
