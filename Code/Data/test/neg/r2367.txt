i bought this laptop last year to use in my business i have always used dell products so i wasn t worried with this purchase i can not not_not not not_wait to replace this laptop and i am not not_not not not_sure if i will go with another dell the keys are cheaper than previous laptops maybe it s just the version i got not not_not not not_sure the windows operating system yes i know it s not not_not not not_the dell issue but it added to my annoyance with this laptop the scrolling is hard the right click never works sometimes trying to power it up from a sleep mode take 5 or 6 tries and i have to just restart it to get it to work at all trying to get the sound open to mute and un mute take 3 or 4 clicks before it finally opens everyday there is just something new to annoy me with this laptop
