this is a better laptop than i thought it would be i wanted something with a larger screen and a large enough hard drive where i could store lots of photographs and edit them in lightroom it s fast enough and while plasticy on the inside and underneath the brushed aluminum top is a nice touch and the screen while not not_not not not_true hd and saddled with color and contrast shift when you look at it from a side angle is still bright and sharp and accurate enough to do the job this isn t a laptop you ll lug around with you to coffeeshops as its size makes it more useful as a desktop replacement but that said it s relatively thin and lightweight enough to not not_not not not_be a burden to carry back and forth from room to room or rest on your lap keyboard is responsive and keystroke feels good one thing i did to first was get rid of the bloatware but to be honest compared to a lot of windows pc s there wasn t a whole lot of it and was easy to remove
