i bought an acer aspire r3 2 in 1 that died in 2 weeks after reading ratings of acer as a firm after the fact i decided to buy this hp x360 instead based on newly positive reviews of hp and of this model positives nice keyboard feel good wi fi reception negatives my impression is that the hp is significantly slower than the acer even though both have i3 processors the same memory and hard drive sizes the hp also has a less sensitive touch screen perhaps due to the slightly smaller screen size lots more bloatware was preinstalled i upgraded to windows 10 with no problems except that it literally took hours over cable wifi much longer than the acer in hindsight for 100 less i would risk the acer again in fact if they were the same price i still would
