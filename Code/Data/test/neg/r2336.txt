i slapped a solid state drive in it and installed windows 7 i highly recommend you double check the power settings disabling these helped this little machine a lot a long with making sure window s transparent and other settings were disabled personally i wanted a nifty little machine that i could use to type on maybe play some music or a video when i m out of the house so that i wouldn t have to use and abuse my cell it does the job very well for what i paid for it the processor in mine is definitely on the 34 very weak 34 and can 34 sort of 34 stream a 1080 youtube video though it does mostly okay with 720 all in all for the price not not_not not not_bad edit so even with linux the machine still has problems running more than one webpage at a time if this had a slightly better processor i think this would be a very worthy 4 5 for the price as is i feel that it s a 3 5 since it does about 3 5ths of my main machine s web browsing
