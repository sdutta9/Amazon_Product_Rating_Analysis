worst quality and reliability of any computer i ve ever had multiple fatal errors in the operating system from the factory which caused 20 hours of time with tech support for an additional 239 charge and resulted in multiple resets to factory settings a mouse pad that didn t work properly out of the box and a keyboard that had to be replaced due to keys not not_not not not_functioning this all took place between the end of october new to the end of february at that point i finally gave up and returned the computer and will move on to a different brand i m just astounded at the poor quality of the dell product and will never go back
