i got this laptop from my local staples as i needed to get something quickly to finish a paper on the saturday afternoon my old pc decided to die on me it was on surprise sale there was even a 75 in store coupon to get some items along with it on top of the 100 discount on the laptop itself i ll be honest i picked this one as staples has a generally terrible selection of laptops in canada at least and this one stuck out as the only 13 inch or so model that didn t weight a ton and the price seemed right as i didn t want to go on a spending spree 13 inch display touch screen does not not_not not not_weight a ton 100 75 discounts they got me while being no it pro i do know big brand pcs are riddled with bloatware and i m generally pretty lenient with this stuff as i m willing to get my hands dirty to improve it this hp was no exception first boot was terribly slow things were popping left and right and windows being windows i was prompted to download a million updates and security fixes right off the bat i don t think first impressions should matter in a product like this one because they are bound to be terrible once i had a few hours ahead of me i started removing the crap that came pre installed mcafee anti virus wildtangent games hp branded utilities etc it helped free up some ram and room on the 500 gb hard drive and then one can start taking an honest look at this thing once it s a little cleaned up the good stuff the processor is actually decent it s a quad core chip running at 2 0 ghz with a sort of turbo mode that goes up to 2 4 ghz for short bursts the integrated graphics card reported to be r5 m230 is capable of playing most games at low quality settings and at reasonable frame rates the touch controls on the screen but also on the multi touch trackpad work well decent keyboard decent weight good set of ports connectivity options good enough battery for an all plastic notebook it may look a little cheaply made but it s actually relatively sturdy the meh can be fixed to some degree stuff the 500 gb hard drive is dog slow upgradable if you are technically inclined same for ram the screen s default contrast and saturation are terrible can be improved somewhat via the amd catalyst color settings the speakers while good enough aren t exactly up to what you d expect for something branded 34 beats 34 windows 8 1 is annoying personal note the bad can t do anything about it stuff the screen s resolution tho i was not not_not not not_misled i knew it was a basic 1366x786 screen right from the start the screen s viewing angles the screen s luminosity or lack thereof weird out of sleep wifi and bluetooth issues not not_not not not_entirely sure what s going on there overall for a cheap laptop it s not not_not not not_so bad it really matters what your expectations are and what you will be using this laptop for
