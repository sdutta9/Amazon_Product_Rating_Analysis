oh god wish i could return this without too much hassle the 689 gb hard drive is great if not not_not not not_for the fact that the laptop starts up slow stays quite slow and some of the applications do not not_not not not_even work also what happened to picture previews like you know when you double click on a picture and you expect to see a nice preview of it open up on your screen instead there is an app for it that doesn t work and sometimes when i am scrolling with my touchpad out of completely nowhere the mouse icon disappears and i have to use my touchscreen complicated when you have to use your fingers to click something small it has only been a week since i have gotten this computer but i m pretty sure i will find some more problems in the long run i ve even found one today my iphone takes 4 5 minutes of prolonged buzzing to sync to this laptop amazing it doesn t like this laptop either kt
