this is a great buy for the amount of money that i spent the only thing that it lacks in my opinion is bluetooth but it is not not_not not not_a deal breaker for me if you are a gamer this is not not_not not not_the laptop for you but if you were a gamer you would already know that this is not not_not not not_the laptop for you if you are a student working from home in a non technical field browsing online reading online listening to music this is the laptop for you i didn t purchase a warranty or anything and it has been going strong now for about a year the laptop is so quiet that i forget if it is on when it is in sleep mode the battery life is amazing it lasts for such a long time it would be perfect if it were not not_not not not_for the lack of bluetooth but you can still use the cord ones it has usb a webcam it has 10 key which is a plus and kind of a deal breaker for me at this time the mouse pad is user friendly and it just feels comfortable to me i have streamed netflix my internet speed is great though and the picture quality is awesome the search field on the front screen makes it easy to find anything that you are looking for within the computer itself it has a matte finish and not not_not not not_a shiny or slippery finish and it handles well the only reason that i did not not_not not not_give it 5 stars is because of the blue tooth
