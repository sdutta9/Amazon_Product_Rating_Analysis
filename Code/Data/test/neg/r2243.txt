i am soo disappointed this computer is soo slow my 5 year old toshiba runs faster and that is why i got a new laptop because it was so slow initially i thought the slowness was because i was using programs for the first time and they were doing the initial load but that s not not_not not not_the case i am going to contact dell or amazon to see what my recourse is
