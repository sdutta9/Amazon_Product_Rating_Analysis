for the price i guess it was alright it had a few minor problems that really annoyed me such as freezing but the issue got better over time it s pretty good for a refurbished product but i slightly regret not not_not not not_buying it brand new i gave 4 stars because it s been working alright for me in my first weeks remember you get what you pay for
