do not not_not not not_buy dell their customer service is horrid after paying to have my laptop fixed dell ended up returning it to their warehouse instead of me their solution was to provide me with a refurbished laptop my biggest concern to this was the fact that i had specifically asked for my hard drive not not_not not not_to be reformatted or a new operating system installed when i asked farat herman client technical support specialist why he could not not_not not not_track my laptop s location at the warehouse his initial response was that it probably was re issued to another customer however he had no work order or actual proof that it was not not_not not not_sent out with my personal information as well as confidential company information when i mentioned this he then claimed it was probably tagged for destruction what first it was sent to a customer and now it is tagged for destruction he really had no idea what was happening with it and tried to placate me with any line he could think of in the end i finally said fine send me a refurb laptop but i want a refund since i did not not_not not not_get what i paid for since what i paid for was my laptop back with all of my information on it he said 34 no there is nothing else i can offer and i speak on behalf of the president of dell there is no one else that this issue can escalate to 34 i can t tell you how frustrated and let down i feel from this company and their service really disappointing and i don t recommend buying their products if you expect quality customer service
