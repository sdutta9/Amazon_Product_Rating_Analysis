oh no this dell model is awful in all aspects too slow in any task so ugly and has a really very poor screen definition i buy dell since 2001 from desktops to notebooks by the way my last note bought was an intel i7 xps studio 1645 in 2009 and it worked very well until early 2014 when it crashed at all and unfortunately there was no way to fix it anymore i saw an offer at dell s site last december inspiron 16 i7 fourth generation 8gb ram and so on with 419 discount at 679 but as i had no cash at that time i decided to buy at amazon this trash note when i think that for just 200 more i would get a reasonable note i almost think to kill myself some mistakes can t be fixed anymore so if you want a note that is not not_not not not_just for doing ordinary tasks i would tell you to don t buy this model as actually it is just for dummies sorry if i offend someone but that is what i can tell about it
