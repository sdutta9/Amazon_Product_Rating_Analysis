on the inaugural run the system froze the word hi remained on screen for about five minutes i called customer service they suggested holding in the power button and then pulling out the battery to try restarting the process this was our first impulse but i also wanted to be certain that this hi wasn t indicative of the system booting up turns out it wasn t i can tell you this did not not_not not not_make a great first impression the second time the computer did completely boot up i was a little surprised at the washed out color however i am also just coming from an lg ips display likewise this sound was no different than any other laptop in this price range we started with our itunes favorites but when we agreed that there was a decide lack of depth and warmth to the sound we moved on to audio tests after performing several standard tests we were in accord the beats audio does seem to be something of a gimmick the sound is as tinny as one would expect with a laptop this convertible laptop has more volume then my last two laptops but the sounds is no richer and no deeper i do have some concerns with overheating at one point it became so hot that i had to remove it from my lap and set it on its side on the hardwood floor this is within he first two hours of using it and while it was under no stress i will update this post if this becomes a genuine problem in addition i was frustrated to find that this laptop was flooded with bloatware much much more than a dell or alienware now i must invest time in removing each useless program i haven t bothered to do this yet since i already had a false start and then had to perform audio tests i will surely get to it but it is such a nuisance that it literally becomes irksome the power button located on the top left side is pretty sensitive i already accidentally turned off the laptop simply when holding it typing on the touch screen was as responsive as any other tablet we did have a little difficult with moving over the screen though it seems that the glass could use a higher gloss to prevent fingers from skipping over the screen moreover i quickly grew to dislike the manner in which the laptop converts to a tablet we had a sony vaio duo 13 svd13233cxb 13 3 multi touch convertible ultrabook computer the screen slid over the keyboard here the keyboard is literally facing your lap it is awkward to hold and i worry about the abuse that could be sustained here please note the actual keyboard function is disabled when this is converted to a tablet so if you were worried about accidental typing it is not not_not not not_a concern the touchpad the right click and left click buttons are not not_not not not_differentiated for some this is not not_not not not_a problem for others it will truly be bothersome if you are going to be using this more as a tablet than laptop the computer is much too weighty for that use however if you are mostly using this for the laptop aspect with the bonus of it converting to a tablet the weight is appropriate if you are considering purchasing this because you ve been enticed by the beats audio option you may be disappointed however if you are seeking a somewhat affordable convertible for class or work this may be a contender
