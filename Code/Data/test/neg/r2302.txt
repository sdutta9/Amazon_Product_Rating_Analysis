i should have known that buying a low priced computer would cost money and frustration in the future first it did not not_not not not_come with office probably says this in the information about it but i did so many comparisons i missed it second it came loaded with pop up ware ad ware etc so that it s very difficult to use the internet i removed some of the pre loaded programs and this helped very little i would not not_not not not_buy this again and am so frustrated that i am considering throwing it away i would give it away if i could find someone tech savvy enough to figure out how to get rid of the adware and malware
