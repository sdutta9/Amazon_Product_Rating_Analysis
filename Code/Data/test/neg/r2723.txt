do not not_not not not_buy this from klamps electronics i m giving this product a negative review not not_not not not_based on the quality of the unit i received but because the information in the description was misleading the people who posted the description were either lazy or purposefully dishonest and copy and pasted from a more expensive unit in the description it states 34 horizontal brushing in natural silver with an ash silver keyboard creates a stylish appearance 34 and 34 full size island style keyboard encased in brushed aluminum enables comfortable typing 34 it even shows a silver keyboard in one of the pictures this is not not_not not not_true it comes with black keys on a black surface the picture also shows a 10 key on the keyboard of the silver one this does not not_not not not_have a 10 key the description also states it has an 34 antiglare finish allows easy viewing in bright light 34 it is not not_not not not_anti glare it was confusing having pictures of 2 obviously different machines so i looked to the description to help make a decision incorrectly assuming that information in the description would be correct i would have bought another laptop for less money with the same features had i known the truth hope this helps someone make a better decision
