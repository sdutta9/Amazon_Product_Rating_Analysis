R3286PHCZY4YSW->I love it, the price that I bought it was exellent for all people. I recommended it for people that use this pc for navigate, emails and so much, not for people who work all time with big programs and resolution because is a little slowly in these cases. For example: I am a programmer and it has not  the best performance compared with the macbook pro. You choose what do you want and for what.
R14HKPGUZAUP4Z->MacBook Air , Apple is Apple , you pay for the name . Overall this computer is fairly good. I haven't had any virus' no download problems and no problems with the webcam . I do like that you can use the touch pad to scroll through everything and display through different tabs. I like you can do everything you can do on your phone on this device . The battery lasts me all day and I have to use it all day doing the work I do. Very hard to navigate on how to use at first with using pages or numbers but you get use to it .Cons are the touch pad to move your cursor , glitches . Mine freezes up and won't let me scroll down . I don't like the fact either you pay so much money for this device and there's no disc drive . I don't care for he charger . It detaches easily, and can be frustrating . The magnet isn't very strong on it . I'm on the fence with purchasing any other Apple products the only reason I bought one was for anti virus protection . If you want to have a durable computer this is definitely a purchase for you .
R3LO67RF2MH985->Nothing more to say!
R111UGX8GGRDNR->So glad I didn't get a surface or any other Microsoft. Never going back
R24D7AT266LJW7->replaced once and then returned.  not nearly as fast as a macbook pro with similar specs.  I'm an Xcode developer and this was too slow, constantly got the spinning wheel.  For me, the macbook pro is a better choice - just a little thicker and 1/2 pound heavier but better performance.
R2LEQA1J4GQ0WQ->Only MacBook laptops got the highest resolution and quality sound that I've been looking for in a gadget.
R1HWTVOQ0XPZPT->Got it before the estimate time, in perfect conditions, great product and the cheapest one I found. I'm very happy with this purchase.
R1SVWZ0IJ0XF38->Takes some getting used to, as I've be using a pc for a long time.
R1FD5AAYWV8K0R->It's very slow to start up when I shut it down. It makes me nervous.
R1ZXF3Y6N1DRX4->Great power-efficient laptop that is surprisingly good for high-end gaming. Very thin and light with superior software in Mac OSX. Much beter than any PC I ever used. Responsive and fast. Just wish the resolution was better.
fkjvnkd->I almost forgot how to use a laptop after using primarily an iPad for many years. But this Mac is user friendly and works nicely in sync with an iPad. Easy set up. So far I love it. Great price too!
dnfskvn->I absolutely love my laptop
dnlksnkv->This is my first Mac and so far I love it! It is so light and portable but the screen doesn't fell too small. I like the way the mouse works a lot better than it does on the PC laptops.
mvnvksj->God bless Steve Jobs
vdsnlk->Great Laptop
dnlsknlvks->The product itself is great! i have never had any issues with any apple devices in the past.However this one had a jumpy image while watching videos, so I had to return. The refund process was easy and fast. Already got a new one and happy!4 stars for the odd experience:-/
dflkznvkj->Love this laptop, works great.
vmsdlzknv->Everything I hoped for and heard about.
vdnsnvlsv->I have all of Apples products, iPad, iPhone.. and now my MacBook. This is my first Mac and so far I love it. I am still experimenting and getting used to it. I am using it for my small business- website updating etc.
vslkvnlkv->I like this I have always been a PC girl. I have had to go to the Apple store twice for software issues, which they fixed immediately. I would definitely buy again.
dvklslvkvs->I love my mac Book Air!!!
dnvsknvklsnv->This is a work horse computer for me. I wish I had gotten a larger display for me, but can't beat the price for performance.
vsndlkvnsl->BEST COMPUTER I EVER OWNED BY APPLE AND AT A VERY LOW PRICE WITH QUICK SHIP. A+++++
fdhjfkhdkj->Absolutely wonderful machine! Macbook Air is fast, responsive & just great to use! Much different than using windows, which is awesome! Apple never fails to go above and beyond! From the moment you take this mac out of the padded box you will love it!
dkvslkd->I waited to post this review until I had put the laptop through its paces.... gotta say this was a great deal and a reliable seller. Product is as described and I have had no issues. Would encourage all who read this to buy from them without hesitation.
ksvjnkjv->I was very scared about ordering this because it is a lot of money. But I couldn't be happier, it's brand new and in good shape, it works perfectly for me and my homework since I am in college.
vdvsnvjn->Apple has it listed for same price. The list price here is correct which is very rare here. Excellent laptop. Retina screen is worth every penny. Very fast. Great laptop!
