       " (u\"I slapped a solid state drive in it and installed Windows 7. I highly recommend you double check the power settings - disabling these helped this little machine a lot, a long with making sure Window's transparent and other settings were disabled. Personally I wanted a nifty little machine that I could use to type on, maybe play some music or a video when I'm out of the house so that I would not have to use and abuse my cell. It does the job very well for what I paid for it. The processor in mine is definitely on the &#34;very weak&#34; and can &#34;sort of&#34; stream a 1080 youtube video, though it does mostly okay with 720. All in all for the price? Not bad. Edit: So even with Linux the machine still has problems running more than one webpage at a time. If this had a slightly better processor I think this would be a very worthy 4/5 for the price. As is I feel that it's a 3/5 since it does about 3/5ths of my main machine's web browsing. \",\n",

I revise my previous opinion of this machine. All it needs is a RAM upgrade and it's just fine for the price. I suspect that an additional processor upgrade would make it great for the price. Hands down this is the worst computer I've ever owned. It's barely fast enough to run Netflix videos, and if I do not restart it every couple hours, it will be too slow to use. On top of this, the Windows 8 operating system is extremely poorly designed. I recommend taking your $269 and going to a pawn shop. I ca not imagine you'd do much worse than this machine. \",\n",

Please bear this review in mind with the price. The screen-cover is thin and I'm always conscientious of this, so no heavy things on top; and because it's thin, it wobbles when you adjust the angle and when you move the laptop. The sound is not back and loud enough for my purposes. The DVD player is a bit flimsy but it has not failed and does the job. After MS Vista you cannot buy to own MS Office apps: you RENT or buy the annual license to used MS Word/Office. You'll be paying every year. This is crap--one reason I am keeping my older laptops just so I do not have to keep buying the right to use Office Word or Excell or Access!!! Anyone who uses the Cloud storage for important document is crazy--it's not your document if it's in some one else's home, is it! Keep you own external storage drivers. I would only keep downloaded music in any 'floating' storage facility--I would not even keep pictures in any fluff storage. The picture is sharp, color is true, but the screen is much wider than I'm used to: because of the thinner bezel you have more viewing screen--nothing is wrong with this; I just have to get used to it. Not that crazy about the clear glossy screen; it does reflects too much back image but it does give the picture clear and truer color display; really great watching movies in the dark. I'll be using this for the Internet and saving my older laptop for work. For a couple of hundred bucks, this laptop is a great value. Would have given it 5 stars if it the keyboard was backlit. \",\n",
