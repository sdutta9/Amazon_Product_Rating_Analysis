i ve just upgraded from the surface rt to the surface 2 and it was well worth it for me previously i upgraded to the surface from an ipad2 so here is what i ve found the surface 2 has been an excellent performer besides common tablet tasks like skype web browsing email kindle books ebay and a few other things i ve got a complete microsoft office system that lets me do serious work not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not just viewing files but actually creating content and editing documents the thing runs all day on battery and i m finding that i can get away from using a computer on trips and go for a full week with my surface 2 without carrying my laptop general great battery life its snappy and has a nice screen i use the original type cover from my old surface which works great and use a bluetooth mouse when doing a lot of production work the touch gestures are awesome as is the multitasking where i can have a couple tablet apps up at the same time a negative thing is that some apps are lacking but this is compensated by the fact that you can do the full website version of just about everything improvements over ipad my ipad was a good consumption device for web and apps but it was really bad at several things like writing anything office type apps email doesn t hook up to exchange getting files on or off it without going through itunes playing non apple video files expanding storage connecting with usb peripherals etc the surface 2 is quick it lets me do office i can sync all my documents with skydrive and selectively choose what stays on the machine i can play all kinds of videos but not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not some mkvs awaiting vlc player etc i can copy files on it at will print to printers connect thumb drives and other peripherals etc it lets me do things so i can get things done i also like that the included email program much improved hooks up with business exchange accounts i don t really use the outlook app now included though the sd slot is really nice and i keep a 32gb card full of videos and music for flights although i was worried about not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not being able to install legacy x86 windows programs i feel so much freer than i did with ipad because the ipad felt like a prison to me i do prefer the ipad 4 3 screen to the more awkward 16 9 on surface i don t hate ipads and my wife kids love theirs improvements over surface rt higher screen resolution and much faster speed the old surface actually wasn t too bad at running office and tablet apps but the web browser was sometimes much too slow on complicated pages i like that the surface 2 is much snappier and the windows 8 1 improvements are significant as well especially the improved skydrive it is enough better to finally get me to switch from dropbox by the way the rt dropbox for surface rt and surface 2 is pretty bad the web browser version is even better because you can drag and drop with it overall if you want a tablet that can do productive things and isn t locked down as far as files expandability i think it is worth trying out for a few days i m very happy with mine
