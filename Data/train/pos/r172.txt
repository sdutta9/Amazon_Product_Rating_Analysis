i ordered my tablet and it should be arriving soon i will update this review after i receive it i just wanted to post this because of how i purchased it i also had to order this device from another website because it is too expensive on here i suggest that many do the same by using in stock trackers they are websites that notify you when any reliable site best buy amazon etc has the item you want in stock online only if you google those words you ll find some i won t post the one i used since i don t want to advertise and don t know if that s even allowed just a suggestion especially after i see that some people are actually paying the ridiculously marked up price on here i ll update this review and let everyone know how i like the product after i receive it i have used it at a microsoft store in a mall near by multiple times and i loved it which is why i was so impatient to get it i was most impressed by the build quality and how fast and responsive it was i used both the touch and type cover with it and as you can imagine the type cover is much better but the touch cover was also great not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not what i expected at all i would actually consider the touch cover if it were significantly cheaper than the type but since it s only a 10 dollar difference i d go with the type cover
