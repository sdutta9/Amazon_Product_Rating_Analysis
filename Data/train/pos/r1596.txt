i have two other laptops and have had others in the past but have yet to work with a dell so when i had the chance to try this one out i jumped at the chance so when this came in we opened it up to see what it was all about it came with windows 8 1 which could go either way depending if you like that system or not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not it is really thin and larger than the other two i have it comes with a 500gb hard drive which is very good everything else is just what you would think a laptop would come with so it is on to performance i have read other reviews stating that it ran to slow well so far for me it has worked just fine and i haven t had any issues so it has been working like advertised for me thus far if anything changes i will update for sure
