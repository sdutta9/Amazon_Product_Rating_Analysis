it took me a while to decide on which laptop i wanted to purchase i had a long list of must haves and a small budget as this was my first venture into the laptop realm i wanted to do my home work the dell latitude d630 fit almost everything on my list i was concerned however about getting a pre owned laptop but i made the plunge and came out very satisfied it is fast clean smooth and most of all priced right with shipping i paid a little over 200 00 bucks if you are looking for a laptop as a home use or for business this is an outstanding choice i may purchase another one for my wife at this price
