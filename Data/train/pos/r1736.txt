this is another winner from toshiba this is also a 2 in 1 that really works seamlessly it works right out of the box do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not underestimate this because of the low price tag and small size this is a real workhorse pc when i boot up in the morning this little toshiba plugs thru the day moving seamlessly thru apps websites a good amount of memory for downloading and compact and lightweight so you just take it from one place in the day to another the small size is a surprise plus you can take this around all day long and the 15 inch is heavy bulky and really works best sitting in one place this really does it all for me
