i bought this at the microsoft store and it was my best decision by far i am a senior in university i used the ipad2 and depended on google docs for my assignments the surface 2 is packed with what an average students would need microsoft office internet kindle app email netflix amazon app and of course facebook i purchased the surface 2 clearly for being more productive and it has shown this is like a little stylish netbook but with the fun of your basic microsoft office apps already installed word powerpoint excel one note and outlook there is no trial version for microsoft word powerpoint excel one note or outlook they are pre installed and yours to keep what i love about this is that it has win8 i am able to switch from the new tiles to the traditional desktop interface also skydrive is very useful i can easily edit my documents view pdf files and email documents my surface 2 came with the free 200gb skydrive promo and glad to say that i have only filled 2gb worth of docs the downside with any microsoft tablet phone is the app store there isn t a lot of apps research the apps that you must have at the microsoft app store like i said the apps i usually use netflix facebook amazon are already in the app store there are some popular apps google drive that are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not there so research the apps before committing to the surface another important thing to note is that microsoft actually pre installs a lot of stuff making your 32gb down to 16gb honestly i wished that this was made 5 years ago when i was about to purchase the ipad2 i would ve bought the surface in a heartbeat because it is packed with the stuff average students would need please note test drive the surface at a store before buying it
