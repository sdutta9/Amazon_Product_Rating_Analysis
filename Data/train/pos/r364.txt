i was looking for a tablet to take with me on an upcoming vacation i have a great laptop but wanted something smaller that would allow me to access my email and facebook skype play games and perhaps watch movies on the flight i have to admit i was skeptical when i saw the price of the g tab iota i had never even heard of matricom after spending several days comparing tablets i realized nothing else was available with this many features at anywhere near the price since i knew i could return it through amazon if there was any problem i didn t have anything to lose so i placed my order two days later on a saturday no less my tablet arrived it started up right out of the box the picture is bright and clear the touch screen is very responsive internet works great i watched a full movie with no breaks or pauses like i get on my laptop the camera is a bit grainy but i don t plan on using this as a camera it is fine for skype with video i m sure there is a lot more i can do with this once i take the time to learn more about all the features i couldn t be happier with my decision to buy the matricom g tab iota i would definitely recommend this i love it
