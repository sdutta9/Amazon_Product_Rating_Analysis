i just got the lenovo flex 2 laptop 15 6 inch touchscreen today 10 19 2015 and i am very disappointed the keyboard is horrible very squishy unresponsive and awful to type on have to really push hard on the keys and watch the screen to see if all the letters show up constantly deleting or backspacing to correct i don t hold out for this laptop to last very long it truly is awful take my advice and don t buy a computer unless you can look at it just a heads up from a very disappointed customer buyer beware
