for the most part i am pleased with this purchase i am able to do everything i like and accomplish the needed tasks i don t like the touch screen but i can disable it the laptop is bigger then i m used to however it is pretty thon and light so it balances out the only akward part is the placement of the mouse other then that this computer will do until my next purchase if you are looking for a reasonable priced computer with disk drive usb ports able to connect to the internet and nice sceen for viewing movies etc this is the computer for you
