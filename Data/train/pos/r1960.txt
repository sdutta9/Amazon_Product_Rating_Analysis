i bought this dell product because i read good reviews of it however after setting up my computer i kept getting disconnected from the internet and i got a limited access message on the computer screen it would take about 20 minutes for the computer to actually connect to the internet and sometimes more the internet at home is working right so i called dell support i explained them what the issue was and the dell representative kept me on the phone for about 2 hours just to tell me at the end that my computer had a hardware malfunction and in order to fix the issue i had to pay about one hundred dollars more i don t know if i got unlucky for getting a defective product but i do know that i am very dissapointed on dell products and dell support it is just a trap to get more money i will never buy a dell product again
