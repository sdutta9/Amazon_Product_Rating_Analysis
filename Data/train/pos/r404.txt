i ve been playing around with the sp4 for a couple weeks and have decided to keep it as my primary computer that being said this is typical microsoft where they had a deadline and released a buggy product because they could sp4 i5 16gb of ram 256gb hard drive touch keyboard with fingerprint scanner ordered directly from microsoft for the good i really like this tablet i love the fingerprint sensor on the keyboard the battery life is good enough and overall it s a good experience now for the bugs 1 sometimes when it goes to sleep it won t wake up and you have to restart 2 sometimes the keyboard won t work restart required 3 sometimes the touch screen would just die restart required 4 one time i came back to it and the fan was running full speed even though it was off 5 auto brightness seems a little finicky will initially be too dim then when you give up and brighten it yourself it will go significantly brighter and you have to dim it again then it settles down 6 a little slow to wake up so you are wondering if it s going to require a restart i ve downloaded firmware updates from microsoft s website and the experience is improving and the bugs seem to be going away but they should have just fixed the thing before releasing hence a 3 star rating instead of a 4 5 which is what it deserves when it is working right
