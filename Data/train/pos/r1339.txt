we bought the dell latitude d630 for school work for our youngest the price was very reasonable and the laptop was in great condition unfortunately the laptop had problems connecting to our wifi which apparently was the result of a bad wireless card contacted jeremy s laptops and he made good on his sale he sent a replacement right a way and the replacement works just fine good product and speedy customer service definitely deserves the five stars
