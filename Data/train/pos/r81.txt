i was looking to get something easier to carry with me when i have client meeting for my business than my bulky laptop and so i saw this and it seemed to have the right processor screen size ram etc that would atleast work and then i could give my current laptop to my 12 yr old daughter so this would be a great little tablet if i had chosen the bigger memory 64gb but i think even then i would need more they dont tell you that just the operating system nothing else downloaded or used alone takes up 18gb which doesn t leave much if you are planning on doing anything more than email viewing files off a thumb drive and facebook yes it has a micro sd slot to add to the memory but they don t make them bigger than 128gb and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not even sure that if i bought one if the machine is expandable to that much i cant find the parameters for micro sd also it seems to glitch sometimes where i cant get the screen to come on i can touch it and hear things but cant see anything until i hold and restart the power button a few times i should have bought a another laptop so if your looking for something to do what a laptop does or play games on you will be disappointed if your looking for something to just check email and maybe some internet you will be fine
