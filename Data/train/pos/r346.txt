the g tab iota is a wonderful tablet for its price and it was delivered on october 6th if you re looking for an inexpensive but great quality tablet this would be a great buy i ve have a kindle fire 7 in and had an ipad 1st gen once upon a time i would compare the g tab to the ipad i love mac products i use a macbook pro for work i had like three or four generations of the iphone and i also own a chromebook though i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a techie by any means i am the type of guy people ask about tech toys i also spent about eight hours over a handful of days researching and comparing different tablets much to the chagrin and annoyance of family and my significant other i m very glad i made the purchase i want to list what i like and dislike the pros and cons of the tablet if anyone is interested starting with the cons it feels a little cheap compared to other tablets it feels a little brittle despite the metal back even tablets like the kindle fire with that has a plastic back it even creaks when you apply pressure to the corners or sides just a gentle squeeze will do this is just a personal preference but it feels a little light i like heavier tablets because it feels like you re actually holding something in your hands again this is just a personal preference and if you like light weight tablets the g tab is comparable to the weight of the kindle fire it s hard for me to notice a difference in weight when i hold both my kindle and the g tab in my hands the battery is awful if i wasn t so happy with the other features and benefits for the price i d give the g tab a two or three star rating i sometimes have to charge it twice a day to full power it runs down to 60 ish within 45 minutes depending on what i m using it for i use the g tab for reading news email and checking facebook mostly when i play any games or watch video the battery life is even worse when my kindle fire is fully charged and i only use it for reading news books or similar tasks my charge will last two days or more the headphone jack cracked a little it s barely noticeable and i had a problem with no sound coming through the day i noticed it but now the sound works fine with a good set of headphones and you ll need a set of headphones if you re going to watch a lot of video or listen to music if you re just watching a clip you found online the speaker if fine if you re watching netflix or whatever you ll need to plug something in this is more a personal preference too i don t love reading e books on it i think i got so accustomed to the size of my kindle it s hard for me to handle the extra three inches it s great for reading news emails and other quick reads though the cameras aren t very good the pros it s just a wonderful tablet for the price the screen resolution and color are great like most all tablets you ll have a hard time seeing the screen outdoors it s fast some people have complained about the wi fi speed but i haven t noticed any problems it s as fast or faster than my kindle in the same locations in the house i ve used the call features on facebook messenger and google s hangouts and the calls come in really well if the connection to the internet is good i haven t used it for video chat though the selection of apps is fantastic this is important to me because i wanted a tablet i could use lightly for work and mostly for play but the kindle absolutely didn t cut it for work the amazon app store is horrid when it comes to selection and honestly all around for just working most of the time i like to use to do lists email and other apps that help me work more efficiently and the g tab is sufficient for my work needs overall i recommend getting the g tab if you re looking for a good tablet it is serving as a filler for the next three to six months for me but if the battery was better i d plan on it being my main device and give it a five star rating
