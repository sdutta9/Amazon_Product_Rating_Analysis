mostly love the surfacebook its a great looking and feeling device its a premium product to rival the flagship devices from any competitor it boots up quick windows hello logs me in with out even having to type in or swipe in a password by just seeing my face the fulcrum hinge is functional and aesthetically pleasing love that it has 2 usb ports and the sd card slot my only complaint is that the display drivers crash a lot mostly in edge i suspect this will be corrected soon with a driver software update once this is fixed and you got a five star product i can t say i m surprised by this new processor new device relatively new os there s bound to be some problems microsoft has been quick to resolve most of the bugs quickly with 2 firmware updates and a slough of other driver and os updates that have corrected a number of problems
