this isn t a bad computer it definitely gets the job done for simple task like school work i love that it came with microsoft office preloaded and i didn t have to spend the extra money to get that something i don t like about it is that it s the rt version now when i bought the computer i had no idea what rt meant nor did i bother to look it up i found out later that because of this you could only download apps from the app store instead of being able to download from the internet so i couldn t get itunes on my computer because it was in the app store which was a bummer also just and fyi the microsoft app store seems very limited it s nothing like the google play store or the itunes app store many programs like pinterest and other majorly popular apps weren t available overall it served it s purpose i was just disappointed that i didn t get all the perks i would recommend getting the pro version if you have the money
