after significant research online days and days worth i decided upon this device to use for school it mostly sits on my coffee table i carry it to class once a week for the past five weeks during class a few weeks ago i picked it up to move it about one foot left and i heard something pop it was a little black cover from the wires that go from the keyboard to the screen since that time the screen has been popping apart at the base in the lower right corner i finally had to superglue it to make it stop doing that given that i barely use this and i rarely travel with it i take really good care of it i didn t expect it to fall apart this easily i m really disappointed since i fell in love with the asus zenbook through work and wanted an affordable asus for home i m past the return date and this kind of thing doesn t show within 30 days so i m kind of stuck i guess i ll go with the chromebook or acer next time lesson learned
