first off what is amazon thinking this is 300 more than best buy or windows store just crazy is it to keep kindle sales up weird don t buy through amazon unless price point drops well below 600 now for product review excellent well made device that shows marked improvement in speed and video audio quality versus 1st generation surface the stereo sound is excellent keyboard is a must integrates with nearly any keyboard but surface keyboard is amazing i love that it already has drivers for wireless printing and every other device i own usb 3 is lightning fast and hdmi works wonders with tv and projectors also a piece of cake to plug into monitor i can t help but think that if this had an apple logo it would be hailed as one of the best innovative machines i also looked seriously at purchasing the pro 2 but found this device really has all i need microsoft office is perfect on device being able to video a presentation in one pane while typing notes in another is slick and has no lag multiple panes for working with powerpoint or word and excel is also a huge plus this thing is also an incredibly durable device it has survived multiple drops without a scratch
