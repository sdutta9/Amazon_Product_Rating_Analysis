i m a long time surface user beginning with the 2 and recently the 3 debated quite a bit before buying the 4 totally sold screen is awesome and you ll notice there are no visual pixels like with the 2 and 3 even when up close the pen had mix reviews but it is totally a better experience than the 3 the tip slows your writing just a bit and my writing looks just like paper the bump in processor speed over my i5 3 is awesome couldn t believe how much faster browsing and other functions were my only gripe is the auto brightness flickers at low levels and bothered my eyes a bit of a pain but i adjust to 25 50 75 or 100 when i m taking notes in a darker room i have to adjust manually i bought this from a microsoft store and did have a problem with the first one it bricked after a windows update took it back and got a new one in a box second one is terrific
