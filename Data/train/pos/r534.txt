i never thought i d find a tablet that could replace a laptop but this one really seem to be able to do just that as long as you buy the keyboard with it you aren t going to do any heavy photo or video editing with this tablet but for basic home use it s been great so far this is my third tablet but first windows based one windows 10 is so far very good in both tablet and laptop mode all of the ms office products work very will with the tablet to the point that i haven t found anything this thing can t do so far i m using it right now to type this review and it is as simple to use as any laptop i ve ever used so far no complaints about windows 10 except for a lack of apps for the platform i can get a ton more apps for my android tablet but i guess that is to be expected until windows gains more of a share of the tablet market which this tablet might just help them do i still turn to my android tablet for many of the tasks i have always used it for but when i need a computer this is my go to device it s portable enough to use in meetings and powerful enough to use for just about everything i need to do
