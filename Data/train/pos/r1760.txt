i use this to project directly to my smart tv and to my older tv with a ptv200 the only problem i have encountered is with some sites there is a vibration on the speakers when i contacted toshiba and played a song that would normally cause this problem it was fine for the price it is great i just love the collapsible keyboard and how light it is i also run many programs with it only problem is that sometimes i get a high cpu usage when using a browser and doesn t make a difference which one it is because it is adobe or silverlight that bogs it down i make sure i close all my other programs and it still does it but i love it just the same since it really doesn t stop the videos it just gives me warnings great buy for a student for sure it s true brite screen is fantastic that is why i always buy toshiba for their crisp colors and great displays
