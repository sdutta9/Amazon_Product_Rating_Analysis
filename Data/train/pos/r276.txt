it s been about a month since i ve had it and i ve fallen madly in love with this dell laptop i have the upgraded version with ssd drive and the quickness of boot wake up sleep and shutdown is amazing just like a tablet dell did an amazing job here putting together all the best features of an ipad and windows pc windows 10 rocks it s easy to use and makes me feel like old windows all over again i put together a desktop setup for this laptop already had a monitor bought an external 3gb hd drive and keyboard mouse so it s easy to use on my desk when i need a bigger screen and still take it into the living room kitchen all over the house when i need a super portable laptop the weight doesn t bother me at all in fact i easily rest it in my lap with the keyboard folded behind the screen it s about 3x as heavy as an ipad but i really hardly feel the extra weight the 13 inch touchscreen is so easy to use and comes in handy when keyword is folded i also use the touch screen even when i have the keyboard in front of me since it s so easy the touch feedback and sounds when you touch the screen and type are high quality and very unobtrusive at the same time they help you navigate and let you know what you re typing and touching value for the price is outstanding
