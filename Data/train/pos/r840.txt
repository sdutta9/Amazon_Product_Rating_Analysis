wow this is a sharp looking laptop the silver is a very nice alternative to black the keys work smoothly and are easy to read i really love the lighted keyboard and its cool that you can have the keyboard lit up or turn it off i usually don t need to look at the keyboard when typing but it sure is handy to have it backlit this is my first touch screen laptop so i was surprised to find out that there is a touch screen keyboard feature i read several reviews about this unit and that s what helped me decide to buy this one this is my second dell and i m sold on their products
