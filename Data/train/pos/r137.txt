i have an ipad air provided for me by my company it works well for its intended purpose but it is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not suited to my needs i love my surface 2 it comes complete with microsoft office and i use it daily it is light reliable and has great battery life i liked it well enough that i purchased one for my wife i find the usb port and the micro sd slot to be a vast improvement over the limitations of my ipad the display is excellent and like the ability to run apps side by side the wedge mouse and the keyboard are great accessories for this product
