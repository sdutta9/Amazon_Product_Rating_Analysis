i recently purchased the g tab for a mother s day present for my mom i m relatively tech savvy and did some serious shopping of what was offered in the 10 34 category unless you are going to use this tablet for taking pictures skyping a lot or need serious processing power this is the tablet you want it powered up right out of the box and the first thing you notice is damn that screen is excellent the resolution and brightness really is the best characteristic of this product and frankly that s what a tablet is for it has it s own kind of matricom android load which is snappy but had some difficulty customizing myself basically because it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a 34 clean 34 load and has some of their own apps i was able to quickly connect to a wifi signal and begin downloading and configuring it for my mom i was able to create instagram and facebook accounts in about 10 minutes and had the whole thing configured in about an hour with all the icons widgets apps before i sent it to her pros the screen is sharp bright and responsive a there is about 11gb of user storage which is more than plenty for most people the screen transitions aren t super smooth but the unit is very snappy opening apps updating etc good power the battery is great i think a full charge lasted the entire day i spent configuring it with screen brightness on full sleek design good bezel metallic back decent build quality slot for microsd card which pretty much puts you at infinite storage arrived in an attractive boxing with very good packaging and all the power usb cables it arrived with a screen protector already applied and an extra in the box i received an email followup asking about what i thought and with direct contact information and a forum for discussions i don t know for sure but my guess is matricom has some pride in their product and good customer service value cons the only actual negative thing are the cameras both cameras and or the software are sub par if you are one of those people which i hate that walk around town taking pictures with your tablet then this won t work and you need to buy a new mobile phone both cameras were choppy low res couldn t focus well and there s no flash that said it s a tablet and there may be android apps that can help really a small gripe is the screen was a little jumpy with very subtle finger movements that might be because i have large fingers or i needed to calibrate it but it wasn t annoying but noticeable the power button location for whatever reason always seemed to be in the 34 wrong 34 place i don t know if it s a cultural thing but i seemed to constantly have trouble finding it i didn t have a problem but the charging port and module seemed small enough to be a problem like real small if this thing is charging and your dog or kid grabs and pulls it at 90 degrees my guess is it will break off so just be responsible overall my wife has an ipad2 and this was just as fast or better in every category except the cameras if i could give this 4 5 stars because the cameras are so bad i would still give it a 5 because the screen and everything else is that good
