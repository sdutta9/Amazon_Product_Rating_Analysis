well so far the surface pro is nice but the pen died in under and hour i tried all the troubleshooting online and then went to microsoft for support after 90 minutes of dinking around they finally agreed to replace it they said it should arrive in 6 8 days ouch i just ordered another pen on amazon which arrives in a day hopefully it was a fluke
