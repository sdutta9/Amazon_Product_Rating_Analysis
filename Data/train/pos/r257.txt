just received it this morning i ve been testing for a few hours and getting rid of unwanted junk there isn t much of that thankfully just a few remarks and observances that might help with buying decisions especially addressing previously reported issues 1 fan noise i immediately downloaded win 10 and the fan did come on for quite a while but i can t hear it i can feel slight flow out of the top back of the unit and if i put my ear directly on the opening i can vaguely hear the sound of distant winds maybe a resolved issue 2 touch screen dead spots i can t find any i m far from being any sort of artist but spent 20 minutes drawing graphs all over the place seems to be very symmetrical and precise one point possibly worth noting the stylus is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not active read many places that it came with a nice one and it is cool just never read either way 3 speed after a ton of research this is as fast as you are going to go right now at this price point with all of these bells and whistles if you want them mac pro has a better chip i5 5257 do the comparison and 1866 mhz ram but far less functionality and 400 more i upgraded my 18 34 gateway to 34 10 34 and that sealed the deal for me it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not mac os yet but a huge leap in speed simplicity and integration end of the day this thing is screaming fast quality seagate drive just up the road from me a complete restart from shutting down to all up is 12 twelve one one thousands seconds and from sleep is 4 seconds no apps office or personal files loaded streaming video works perfectly the hd 5500 seems far more than equal to that task again the i5 5257 has the new iris 6100 which is a much faster gpu but at a hefty cost with no touch pick your poison i think the 5500 will do everything anyone would ask of it except gaming but then the 6100 isn t going to do that either say external card 3a the ac wifi card is way faster than g i have 80 mb s hard wired and get about 9 mb s on my gateway in the living room distant from the router this hit 66 mb s on the xfinity speed test out of dallas 100 miles in the same couch spot 4 etc some say they have trouble with the touchpad but seems impeccable way better than my last small laptop unexpectedly the keyboard is amazing tactile is perfect and the separation between the keys is spot on imho i m 6 3 34 5 and best of all no buyer s remorse one day in anyway
