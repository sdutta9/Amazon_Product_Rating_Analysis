this laptop is great for anyone looking for a better quality laptop without having to pay the price of a mac works great for college students and anyone looking to get the most out of their laptop i am currently a college student that uses his laptop 2 3 times a day for everything from taking notes using school applications listening to music checking social media and everything else in between here are some of the different criteria i base my review of the laptop on durability surprisingly very durable for how light it feels i have accidentally dropped it onto the floor a few times and it has virtually no damages except a few scratches battery life battery life is pretty good the only issue i find is that even when i close it and put it into sleep mode it still seems to lose a substantial amount of battery i usually charge it every other night or whenever i am by my charger if i am using it a lot processing speed very pleased with the i5 processor much faster than i expected and is great for everyday use compatibility has everything you need from a cd insert usb port and hdmi icecool technology doesn t seem very important but you really notice the difference in reduced temperature after long use gaming i have done no gaming on this laptop so i am unaware of how the game play is negatives a few weeks ago the screen would not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not stop flickering eventually it stopped and haven t had the problem since maybe it s just me but when you click it is really loud so i had to buy an external mouse so it wasn t so distracting during class other than those two very minor things this laptop runs great i would compare it to the look and feel of a mac but a slightly less quality whether this is your work or play laptop it will mostly be a good fit for you hope this helps with your laptop search p s i got a very good deal on this laptop closer to the holidays so if possible keep your eye on it until you can get the best deal
