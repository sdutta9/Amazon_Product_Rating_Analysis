we had issues with this laptop from the minute we got it since we have had other dells that we were happy with we thought it may have just been that laptop and we got a replacement we received the 2nd one and it was worse that the first one they both seem to have had hardware issues and was unusable we had great service from amazon and the 3rd party company we received the 1st laptop and the replacement very quickly so disappointed because this laptop had everything we wanted and a great price
