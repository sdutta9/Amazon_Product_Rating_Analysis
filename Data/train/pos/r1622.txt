this computer is quick to start up and easy to work with only draw back is when in the tent configuration it is hard to figure out how to flip the screen so everything is viewed correctly instead of upside down other than that the weight is perfect lighter than a book keyboard is a good size were you can easily type with two hands or you can just as easily type with one the tablet mode is great when just taking notes or watching a show or presentation
