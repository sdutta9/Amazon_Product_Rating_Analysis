i use the tablet as a pseudo laptop replacement despite not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not being able to run legacy apps it s quick and responsive and frankly i don t open my laptop any longer unless i have to my wife and i have two separate accounts on the same device hence we can share the tablet and keep our emails and apps separate the app selection is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not as plentiful as you will find in the itunes or the playstore but i haven t found anything that i absolutely needed or missed that being said the windows store is actually getting better by the day and the tablet comes with some nice built in apps most of all office anything in between can be replaced by ie 11 which is actually a flash enabled browser office works great and only lacks macro support if don t know what macros are you more than likely never use them the os itself is fairly easy to learn but may take a day if the user is coming from ios and has no familiarity with windows 8 once learned you will realize it s probably the most versatile and best tablet os on the market having the ability to have two apps side by side is easy to dismiss unless you actually start using it on a regular basis on a tablet i don t have much more to add on top of the already glowing reviews from many of the users since most of what i do is centered around the internet and some office i don t find myself missing legacy apps as much as i thought i would given that i have taken my surface 2 as my sole device on my last two trips there are really only two criticisms that i have of the tablet first 32gb doesn t really go as far as you think it would even on a tablet however you can clear maybe an extra 3gb by creating a recovery drive on a usb stick and you can also add up to an additional 64gb via a micro sd card second the type cover which is an absolute must have accessory is overpriced otherwise i am extremely happy and the surface 2 has actually exceeded my expectations
