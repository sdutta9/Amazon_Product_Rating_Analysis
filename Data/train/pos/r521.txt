traded up from my ipad mini since all my schoolwork especially some technical programs are windows based the ipad is great but my productivity has increased greatly with the surface also since i have lower back issues the relief from the strain of carrying my laptop without losing windows os was welcome indeed taking notes is a breeze very accurate even with cursive some technical issues with the surface pen one note and windows 10 with right click going nuts but that s windows 10 fault as i ve seen this issue commonly online great for students although if you need to use heavy graphics or a need greater processing power programming for example i would recommend the pro or notebook versions if you are staying pretty light this version is fine though i ve pushed my surface 3 a bit and have yet to be disappointed
