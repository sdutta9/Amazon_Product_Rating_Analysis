as an entry level laptop this one is very good it has a nice screen decent build quality and is fast enough for every day tasks for starters and clarification i m reviewing the core i3 version that comes with windows 10 additionally it s somewhat confusing to figure out but this laptop has 4gb ram pre installed but still has a single accessible and open slot for more ram the previous reviews i read were somewhat confusing as some said there s an open slot and others said the ram is soldered in i think both are true as the 4gb built in is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not accessible via the small cover on the bottom of the laptop but when you remove that cover you find an empty slot the manual installed on the pc itself is more current than the one you find via the asus support pages unfortunately it doesn t list the max ram specs although i ve found info that says the max ram is 12gb which means you could install an additional 8gb in the empty slot for what it is it s reasonably fast and windows 10 works great on the limited cpu and memory the full hd screen is a definite improvement over standard resolution screens and it s nice to be able to see more of web pages and applications my son has a very similar laptop he got last year which has the previous gen i3 processor same amount of ram and windows 8 they run similarly but since his has a touchscreen windows 8 isn t all that bad on his i d prefer this laptop with windows 10 a higher resolution screen and the newer generation processor my point in all this is that the price is in line with what you get as for the build you ll find this laptop is lighweight for its size and the plastic shell will flex in the center of it whether you re simply typing or picking it up the texture does a great job of resisting fingerprints and it s more subtle than i thought it would be i found that the keyboard misses keys more often than i d like particularly with using the spacebar with my right thumb i think part of that might be due to the flex of the shell the 34 ice cool 34 feature works although it s nothing that is groundbreaking i ve had other laptops that don t heat up all that much too otherwise it is quiet and keeps relatively cool when using the power cord brick is more like an ipad charger than a typical laptop charger plus the cord is fairly short since it s only one piece it s nice for travelling but short to route behind a desk or around obstacles like couches or chairs while i wouldn t necessarily want to work on this laptop all day long it s plenty good enough to use on the couch for the kids homework and other simple tasks the price 350 at time of writing seems fairly well in line with entry level laptops as well
