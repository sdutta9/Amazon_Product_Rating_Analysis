i was definitely concerned about buying a refurbished computer but i was reassured by the warranty and return window and this computer works beautifully i will say there was some initial bugs to work out with it just simple stuff and i did have to buy an external cd drive to install my office but having worked out those things i can t say enough what a great laptop this is after bad experiences with other computer brands i swore i would never buy anything other than dell again even though they are more expensive because dell computers work for years it s a fast computer and it s just like having a clean brand new one at a much lower cost than if i bought a new dell i would buy it again
