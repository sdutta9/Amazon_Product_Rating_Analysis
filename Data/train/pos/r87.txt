i bought this to upgrade from the original surface and hoped for even better of a tablet i got exactly that and even more i love using this more than i ever enjoyed using a laptop everything runs well and i love the fact that it comes with microsoft office already i take it everywhere and can t find a single thing to complain about if you are thinking about getting this tablet you have to get the keyboard with it this is the one i got here on amazon 62 keyboard matches perfectly and also acts as a protective case over the screen when you are transporting it you won t regret purchasing this i promise
