4 stars because it seems to be running slow all of a sudden without reason otherwise a decent laptop for the price the only negative thing i can say which is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the fault of the laptop mfg is about the packaging i was shocked to see how this was packed for shipment the box was ripped barely taped closed and there was absolutely no protection just horrendous i was surprised the unit wasn t broken there amazingly is no real damage and it is working so i am keeping it as of now i have received pillows by shipment with better protection overall decent for the price but wouldn t order again due to lack of care in packaging and shipment
