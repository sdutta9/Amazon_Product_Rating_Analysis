we were absolutely thrilled to receive this dell inspiron laptop we are an extended family and always need a good computer one great thing about this computer is it s ease of use it took very little time or effort to get this dell inspiron up and running i have dealt with computers that were not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not as user friendly it is ready to go just plug in and start using the weight of this dell is also a plus not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not heavy and cumbersome to carry around going from room to room or place to place is no problem the battery life is great no need to carry the plug with you everywhere just charge it up and the battery will last for an acceptable time that is a great plus i like the black textured outside finish and the keyboard is fine too for the price and daily use this computer is good for us i know that there are other more expensive laptops out there that would be better for such things as watching movies at faster speeds etc but this computer has been great for basic use
