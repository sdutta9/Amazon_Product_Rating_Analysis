yes windows rt is very limiting battery life is very good and the limited number of applications that support rt are pretty snappy ie on rt is very good to get full windows capability you have to pay 2 5x as much since i mostly use my s2rt almost exclusively at home i ve found a way to make it very useful powerful i run splashtop streamer on my main desktop pc i5 with plenty of ram and ssd the splashtop client is available for rt and works very well effectively this combination lets me take my desktop pc anywhere it can be used from anywhere on the internet full i5 cpu for processing and access to all my programs and data in this case splashtop is pretty responsive including video so there is little lag splashtop is optimized for nvidia which is what is used in the surface and on my desktop there are other remote access apps too team viewer is one that has an rt client that can do the same thing
