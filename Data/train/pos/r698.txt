i like the laptop having it used only for about 30 hours by now however it came with the notorious bing i hate like everyone else hates it it s horrible i can t delete it yet though i ve tried a few techniques is the bing search engine a punishment for those who nowadays buy windows os have to get rid of it which is a huge waste of time it s sad that dell for the cost of that laptop couldn t to equip it with ms word ppt and excel which makes the buy like buying a car without a wheel the laptop is quite heavy though it s without a cd drive which used to add to the weight all the screensavers that are provided with the system are looking pessimistic and dull i ve downloaded windows 10 which for a day of a true inquisition made me to recover my laptop back to windows 8 1 it s a shame how buggy the windows 10 os is and is designed as if the programmers have never studied the good rules of gui save the users time and keep it user friendly
