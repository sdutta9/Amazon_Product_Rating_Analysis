the large clickpad style touchpad is similar to what we ve seen on recent high end dell systems it works fine for basic navigating and tapping or clicking but i also find the all important two finger scroll to be not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not as smooth as i d like or as smooth as one would expect from a macbook it felt notably smoother using microsoft s ie11 web browser than in google s chrome navigating up and down long web pages often sent me to the touchscreen on the first higher end xps 13 we reviewed but in this less expensive non touch configuration you re out of luck the 13 3 inch display has a nearly borderless edge to edge design available in two versions a 3 200x1 800 pixel touch panel and a 1 920x1 080 pixel non touch version we ve now had a chance to test and use both versions and which one you choose makes a fairly significant difference to the overall experience
