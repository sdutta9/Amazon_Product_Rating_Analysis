let me preface my review by saying that i ve been a mac apple user for about 8 years now a friend of mine who is very knowledgeable about computers has relentlessly teased me about it and insisted that mac apple products are highly overrated and overpriced so when i was looking to buy a second more lightweight machine i heeded his advice and bought this device i haven t ever wanted to throw a laptop against the wall or out the window more than i have this device i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a techie so i can t talk about it like one i will just highlight the main reasons i hate it firstly no matter how many times i try to adjust the screen i can never get all of the viewable parts of a web page document to fit in the screen there is so much bloatware installed on the machine and then the things that used to come free with windows microsoft products do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not come free anymore and in fact office is subscription based now wanting a minimum of 8 99 a month and you can t even view ms word documents unless you subscribe to the service so i m having all these software and function issues and my friend who recommended i buy this machine is telling me all these very complicated ways to fix the problems usually involving installing more programs etc also he s telling me to do all these things to avoid the default updates to windows 10 and i just keep thinking over and over how i wish i d just shelled out the extra moolah to buy a mac at least everything i need comes already installed no bloatware and everything works on a mac sorry to offend the anti mac people but that s how i feel
