with the introduction of microsoft s surface 2 microsoft set out to reinvigorate their own attempt at the premium hardware space in the tablet market the first surface rt was a disaster at least initially from hearsay the latest updates and the introduction of windows 8 1 have really addressed some of the lag issues and shortcomings of the user experience be that as it may microsoft would like you to try windows rt and like it with the exodus of other hardware oems scrapping and abandoning their own windows rt tablets it left microsoft as the sole provider of an rt experience with their new surface 2 tablet they re trying to make rt sexy if that s even possible i felt that windows rt was a compromise and that it shouldn t exist it makes some concessions in an effort to extend battery life and it does so by using arm as it s processor muscle that means no legacy x86 apps like the full adobe creative suite photoshop dreamweaver etc and all the other professional grade programs that you come to expect on a windows machine as a graphic designer and amateur photographer having a limited tablet with no support for photoshop was a deal breaker having said that i have to say that i get what windows rt and to that extent surface 2 is about let s face it the problem with windows rt isn t an operating system problem but rather a marketing one simply put microsoft is just terrible at explaining things it doesn t know how to describe the key benefits of an rt tablet to a particular consumer now to be honest windows rt is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not going to fill everyone s needs in fact i feel this product is better suited to students as a replacement for aging laptops and for professionals like me that need a companion device to service their mundane tasks like web searches portfolio displays and light office tasks like word documents and powerpoint presentations the way i ve worked the surface 2 into my work flow is by using it as a portable device that allows me to check images on the field to make sure i captured everything perfectly surface 2 allows me to hook up my dslr and see my raw files through skydrive on that beautiful 1080p screen as a display for my portfolio i can let potential clients check out previous work in the form of a slideshow again through skydrive and have a compact and light device that allows me to check the internet when i need some assistance finding a particular location for simple tasks of that nature surface 2 really addresses those needs it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not just that since i would also be hesitant to bring along my full work laptop around the size and form factor of my laptop just doesn t help when i m on the field as it s too cumbersome to carry around plus it helps that i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not carrying around the source of my livelihood around with the potential of theft or damage the surface 2 can be stolen knock on wood and i wouldn t be left out in the cold and without a way to get critical work done that brings me to the hardware itself this tablet is discreet enough and slim enough that i can lug it into my backpack without a noticeable bulge the fit and finish is incredible and it feels great in the hands the silver tone vapormg is a step up from the black casing the first gen surface has and the screen is brilliant and displays pictures with such vibrancy that it adds a new layer of pop that my laptop lacks i can t stress enough how good the screen is on this thing the two stage kickstand is functional and i can t see myself not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not having it on my tablets ever again it s a joy to not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not have to fiddle with a tablet because the angle of the kickstand just sits well when laying down in bed in a chair or at the table microsoft really nailed this one the other accessories like the touch cover which i have a first gen one really extend the functionality of the surface 2 the audible snap of the magnet adorned keyboard when it latches on to the surface is satisfying when using the surface 2 for office purposes the keyboard and tablet combination is almost perfect while the touch cover is serviceable it does take some getting used to i m using it to write this review and i can type at a good clip there are times when i lose my way since there is very little tactile response from the keyboard due to its flatness however once i m locked onto the proper f j position to type i can fly without a problem the way to go if you re going to use surface 2 primarily for typing is the type cover 2 with backlit and full functional keys the type cover 2 is much more comfortable to type on but if you re seldom going to type essays the touch cover will do spring for the cyan version if you can the silver cyan combo is eye catching there are some negatives of course and some things that cancel themselves out the most obvious complaint when it comes to windows rt is of course the lack of app support yes people will want instagram and whatever else the it app of the moment is on tablets the stuff you can find os ios or the android marketplace however for most stuff if you can t find the official app most likely you wont miss much since surface 2 has a great running internet explorer app with full flash support this makes the whole no support of such apps moot since you can still get to use the app through its website equivalent don t get me wrong some apps just don t have a website equivalent and thus you won t get to play with it period but for the most part the major things you want can be access through ie on the flip side you do have some things that other platforms don t have such as halo spartan assault the aforementioned office suite and some killer tools like great integration of xbox 360 and skydrive services still microsoft has to do better at supporting its tablet with rich game content which should be a no brainer but at least things are improving as we speak the last bit i want to talk about before finishing off is this is this tablet for you in some cases yes and in some no if you need to get work done and are just fine with web searches and using websites instead of apps for music streaming photo viewing and commenting on social networks then surface 2 is more than enough i ve found a way to work it into my work flow and it does work well even after i was highly skeptical of the windows rt platform can it stand to use some minor improvements sure but that s with any tablet out there the real test is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the tablet itself as hardware it s rock solid and impressive rather the investment is solely dependent on the success of windows rt if surface 2 and to a greater extent nokia s 2520 model succeed then yes windows rt has a future and microsoft will support it until it becomes a viable ecosystem on its own but if surface 2 follows the same path as its first gen big brother then investing on surface 2 as a platform wouldn t be wise i can t tell how well it will do although microsoft is betting big bucks into it by infusing 406 million dollars of marketing muscle behind it i suspect it will do alright squeak in enough interest for consumers to keep it alive for at least one more life cycle into 2015 the app situation should improve dramatically in the next couple of months as adoption ramps up and with a few improvements to windows 8 1 rt could be a really good operating system what it comes down to is your own work flow and how a tablet like this might fit in it for me i understand its limitations but also appreciate what it does in other spaces in my daily usage i think as a tablet it rocks and makes life easier and enjoyable when dealing with the internet of things if you give it a try i think you would too update a month with the surface so i ve had the privilege of using the surface for a solid month after purchase with plenty of reviews by tech journalists and different individual consumers i have to say that most of the tech journalist are full of bunk lets be fair here most of those reporters have a carousel of devices coming in and out of their mitts on a given basis to really give a product its fair shake one must live and breathe with the product for a solid month at least to see its idiosyncrasies be it detrimental or encouraging you really have to put a product through the daily paces of one s life after a solid month i have to say that surface 2 is a great product first the device works wonderfully as a laptop replacement for those mundane tasks like web surfing and office work it s incredible how much i ve reduced my usage of my work laptop i ve barely touched the thing due to the fact that the surface is incredible for its portability and battery life sure photoshop is still something i need for my work life but the fact that i can stream all my media netflix hulu youtube through ie11 never mind the apps available for such services through this machine has almost made my samsung laptop obsolete if the full adobe creative suit came to the surface 2 i m dreaming but you can always dream right i m sure i d forgo the laptop all together the app marketplace has improved somewhat with the inclusion of flipboard which looks amazing and other apps but in reality it s still the same as it was a month ago i don t see much movement in that area it could be a deal breaker for some interested in apps like pinterest and instagram but again ie11 can take care of most circumstances that arise when an app is missing gaming is much the same which is that it s still missing some killer apps halo spartan assault is really good graphically and the new asphalt 8 airborne is bananas but other than that it s pretty bare bones this is something microsoft has to address and take advantage of specially with the launch of the xbox one console games has to be a priority to make surface 2 a true consumption device lastly the support microsoft gives the tablet in the way of updates is incredible there are constant updates to improve battery life and other problems i ve only encountered two instances of bugs but other than that the foundation is rock solid some might complain about the number of updates that come about but i see it as microsoft backing up its product they aren t intrusive and they are mostly done in a couple of minutes overall i m satisfied with the surface 2 i still feel it needs a few more months of maturation specially in the gaming department but most people will love the device and should give it a fair trial to see how well the device can perform for 99 of the people out there if you re on the fence about it don t be surface 2 is a special device worth considering as a bridge laptop replacement device
