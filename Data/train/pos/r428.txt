seems like they should have waited another month or two before releasing this into the wild overall it s an excellently crafted piece of hardware but it has a lot of minor bugs that lead to me returning it because for 1200 after keyboard and taxes i expected a tablet that works next to flawlessly it has a lot of issues waking up i found online that many users have to press a button on the keyboard to exit sleeping it has a lot of issues with chrome although this may be chrome s fault but hangouts won t dock on the bottom bar and if you alternate between touch and mouse your mouse will disappear and won t come back until you restart the unit onenote2016 the built in software that you are stuck with when you push the eraser in has a lot of issues the first thing i did was spend a few hours drawing diagrams for a table i was building and the next time i opened it every diagram i had drawn was missing pieces some small some massive 50 of a diagram was mia just random pieces erased from what i gathered this is some issue that it s had for a while with text processing no fix from ms i had a couple hardware issues the pen s cortana button didn t work and the charger s usb port didn t work beyond these issues the hardware is very well done and i expect this will be an awesome product after if they iron the kinks out but for now it has a lot of small bugs that make it not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not worth keeping for me
