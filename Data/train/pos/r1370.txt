this computer is a great basic laptop i am using it for work and i purchased this refurbished at a wonderful price under 175 00 we have had dell in the past and it seems to be the way to go for buying from a dependable seller who sells good quality refurbished items with positive feedback i would recommend this to anyone who wants an older but decent quality computer to accomplish basic needs for personal use or work
