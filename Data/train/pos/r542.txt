i am a college student and after my older dell computer stopped working i decided to buy a surface i rated my experience with this product based on a couple of factors size is important to me as i would like to be able to easily travel with it speed is also important in that i would like to be able to work on multiple things at a time without having my computer slow down when evaluating the surface using these criteria it is vastly better than what i had before while it is small it fits easily in my backpack and leaves room for books and notebooks it fits on small classroom desks and conveniently folds into a tablet which fits on your lap if you would prefer a larger size the surface pro has a screen 1 5 inches bigger while my previous computer was considered old i had it for almost four years when compared to a new surface it was incredibly slow the surface is able to handle multiple tabs and programs a lot better than anything i ve previously had experience with i can often work on multiple assignments programs and websites at the same time something i could not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not do on my previous laptop additionally i liked that there are multiple colors to choose from when selecting the keyboard and that the carrying cases come in different colors patterns and materials as well if you like to add a personal touch to your belongings this laptop will let you do so as for price it is expensive however they have a 100 insurance policy that will allow you to replace your surface for any reason if it is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not working properly this policy lasts for three years which is as long as my old laptop lasted needless to say for me it was worth it lastly as with all products there are a couple negatives the keyboard is very difficult to clean so be careful when you eat or drink around it however i have found that using a towel with very hot water sometimes helps also the touch screen may become dirty with fingerprints but this can be avoided by not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not using it frequently and washing your hands prior to use overall i am very happy with this product if you are a student looking for a portable quick and customizable laptop i would highly recommend the surface
