first off this is a great computer for the price it has windows 8 which has taken me some time to get used to a camera kept coming on with a live picture of me on the screen i am sure that was my fault the laptop is a bit heavy especially if you are getting used to the lighter tablets etc the battery life is only 4 hours even when i put the computer on low energy mode there is a problem with my space bar i really have to pound it to get it to work and this makes me a bit nervous i had another dell under warranty one time and they sent me a new keyboard and someone in india had to walk me through putting the new keyboard in it was really nerve wracking another problem i encountered was the fact that you can t upgrade the video card because it is built into the motherboard this could be potential trouble also if you try to plug in an external monitor the performance is extremely slow so i wont be doing this either the casing on the laptop is made of plastic and seems really cheap and it is sharp and rough on your wrists this computer may be good as a temporary fix for a broken computer but if you really rely on your computer you might want to pass on this one
