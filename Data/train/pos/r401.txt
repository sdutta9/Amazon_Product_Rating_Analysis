seriously why release a product you know is junk first one stopped working entirely after a few days and several hours of time setting up the device it started with the screen switching to vertical black and coloured lines with a light tap to the top of the device so there s a hardware problem after the second time that happened it stopped working entirely tech support response yes we know it doesn t work properly second one the task bar stopped working after about an hour of use tech support response yes we know it doesn t work properly please reinstall the os by the way you can t use the recovery partition we set aside on the ssd you have to download the same recovery partition and waste a usb stick to be able to use it so two major problems that ms knows are there two crippling problems on a very very expensive device my advice get a mac i hate them the os is difficult to use it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not at all intuitive the keyboard is bad and they re even more expensive but they work and you can install windows 7 on them
