runs much better once you uninstall about a hundred preinstalled apps god i hate windows 8 i bought this comp to use for light gaming on the go so i basically just wiped the whole thing clean right when i got it downloaded steam then made my back up discs touch screen is generally very responsive windows 8 would be a nightmare with out a touchscreen battery is weak when compared to an ipad or other full mobile devices but still better then most pc laptops i ve had now i have the 4gb ram version and it runs just about as slow as i can stand so i would not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not recommend this 2gb version i also got my laptop the 4gb version on sale at bestbuy for 299 so this ad is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a great deal i ve run skyrim and farcry 3 on low graphics quality with little to no lag the screen is a little small for a long game sesh but it makes up for that in mobility besides it has an hdmi out if you want more screen in your face the two in one feature is very functional the hinged feels strong and overall the build feels fairly solid for a pc bluetooth is also a big plus for this little guy it s very lightweight and sleek but can get pretty darn warm with a good load on it i would trade half the sleek of this machine for a few more cooling vents but then again it hasn t really been a problem yet will update if that changes
