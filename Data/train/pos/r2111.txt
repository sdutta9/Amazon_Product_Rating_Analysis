i bought this laptop because my primary laptop a mac is very old and heavy and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not practical for the level of commuting i do on a daily basis i needed something smaller and lighter but only really for general word processing project generating and browsing the internet for work and school this asus so far has been perfect it has been very easy to take along wherever i go and to pull out in class if needed and i love it so much it s the computer i use at home as well of course it doesn t have a lot of memory though i believe it s upgradable but that wasn t a factor for me i can have multiple tabs open and be streaming a video and it holds up just fine it also boots up really quickly and is really easy to use i know a lot of people have complaints about windows 8 and i have been a mac user for awhile now but i have no problems as of yet i definitely recommend it especially for students that don t need to run large programs or commuters
