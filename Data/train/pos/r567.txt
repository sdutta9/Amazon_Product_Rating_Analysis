waited 4 weeks for an expensive paperweight had a few bugs then after 30 min of use the monitor overheated and went black after it cooled down i installed new firmware updates five min later it s dark again this happened 5 or 6 times before i called customer support after being passed to several people i was told to return it the customer support was as dark as my monitor they didn t even attempt to get me to exchange it i think they ve had a lot of returns don t waste your time maybe they ll get it worked out in a couple years although i doubt it
