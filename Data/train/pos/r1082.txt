i bought this laptop to replace my old desktop computer which finally died on me i wanted something portable that would be equally capable of doing everything i used to do on my desktop while giving me the portability and touchscreen features i have become accustomed to using my iphone i had have found that i can do nearly everything i wanted to do surf the web email directions can be done more conveniently on my phone that being said i realized i still need a full computer for other things so i went with this laptop it exceeded my expectations in everyday window 8 is a bit of a change for me and took some getting used to but i appreciate the similarities to using my phone the only thing i would complain about is the very weak volume as others have said otherwise it is perfect one other thing i didn t think about was a backlit keyboard i never gave it a thought but if i ever have to buy another laptop this is a feature i would look for as i frequently use this in the dark the screen itself does illuminate the keyboard but backlit keys would be a definate plus love my new laptop
