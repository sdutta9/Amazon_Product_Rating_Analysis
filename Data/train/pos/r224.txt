i love my surface 2 i ve had it for several weeks now and the more i use it the better i like it i ve found that the surface 2 does so many things so well that i really don t care whether or not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not it runs every last program in the universe in fact i m very happy that it doesn t run many of the old viruses i ve found that i use microsoft office on the tablet much more than i imagined i would and i love it internet browsing email news reading and map apps all work great i especially like that you can do an internet search by just typing what you are looking for without having to bring up a browser and the results are presented so nicely and easy to navigate using the touch interface adding web pages to the 34 reading list 34 so that you can go back to read them later is a nice feature that i enjoy battery life very good it lasts all day for me the wide screen is excellent for watching videos having two pages side by side or having to apps on the screen on the screen at the same time if you re looking for a computer that runs every app in the universe such as photoshop or turbotax then go buy a laptop or a different windows tablet the surface 2 is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not for you surface 2 is for you if you want a reliable yet very powerful tablet that lets you do common things very well while still letting you do productive work with microsoft office i own an ipad 2 and a nexus 7 and they both just sit there collecting dust since i got my surface 2
