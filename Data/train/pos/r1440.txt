i love this computer i have only had it for about a week but it seems to work great it is so much lighter and than my old dell inspirion 1500 series laptop which finally died after 7years i love the fact that all the software i am familiar with was uploaded and ready for my use upon arrival and even had the itunes software downloaded as well there are also so many other extra bonus features not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not mention in original description that i look forward to researching even more it runs very well and connection is very fast i am very happy with the refurbished dell and the cost i would definitely recommend this product to others thank you
