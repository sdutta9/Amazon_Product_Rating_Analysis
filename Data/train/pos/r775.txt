you know the scene from office space where the guys finally get the chance to annihilate the fax machine i am so eager for the day i can do that to my new inspiron 13 700 series 2 in 1 notebook model 7347 and get a non dell replacement i really wish i had done some homework before making this purchase but i instead just waltzed into a staples picked one i liked and took it home you know the old fashioned way this laptop is now 2 months old and the issues began just 1 month after purchase for some background it hasn t left the house since i got it never been put into a bag and transported never had a coffee cup sitting on top of it never been dropped run over flooded or thrown against a wall as it so rightfully deserves a month in a vertical ghost touch would randomly begin on the right side of the screen literally hi jacking whatever i was working on clicking ads closing emails i was writing opening applications zooming even restarting the computer sometimes it won t allow me to even use the mousepad to direct the cursor thankfully i haven t been forced into buying something because of it yet knock on wood after taking the problem to the net i discovered this problem is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not at all unique it is a design flaw the lid is just simply not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not ridged enough for this lightweight computer so the touch screen gets pressed in simply by closing the lid do you ever close the lid on your laptop here s a forum link where this is discussed which includes a video where you can see it for yourself i learned it can be temporarily remedied by gently flexing the screen by hand but in my experience it will return randomly another action that has helped for some to put up with this is to disable the touch screen i called staples to see what could be done their 14 day return policy meant we d be dealing with dell directly which has thus far been less productive than weekday dc traffic at 5pm i may be young but the total lack of accountability i ve seen from dell leads me to believe that the company itself is likely of the same quality as this laptop their one year warranty means that i could have the screen replaced a solution to which i expressed my lack of confidence in noting that others have taken this option to only have the issue persist upon its return they obviously don t get it i truly don t want to touch a dell again but offered that perhaps it could be exchanged for a more sturdy model no that just isn t how they do things in my frustration i once asked so you re saying that you ve screwed me out of 500 silence yep that feels really good with a lack of other options i m going to try the whole screen replacement idea in fact i think i ll send it back every time it occurs for a new screen so long as it is under warranty everyone considering a purchase of dell technology should be aware of this inadequate service and design and i sincerely hope you will vote instead for much better with your hard earned cash
