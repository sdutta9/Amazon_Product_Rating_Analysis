i received a surface 2 tablet from my job i work in it support and these are being handed out to one of the user groups at my company it has quickly become my favorite computer tablet all purpose device the surface 2 hits the sweet spot between portability and usability one thing to be aware of is that to get the most out of this device you really also need the type cover 2 not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the touch cover which i ve heard is basically a useless piece of garbage the reason for this is twofold 1 the type cover 2 is a great useable keyboard i m a fast typist and i have had no problems touch typing on the type cover keyboard it s a little smaller than a standard keyboard but is very well designed as far as tactile feedback and the size of the keys it s really fun to be able to type a lengthy comment or review or email and then go back to using the touchscreen after years of carrying around devices with a touch only interface it is so great to have a keyboard back 2 the type cover 2 functions as a backup battery for the tablet basically you have two batteries one in the tablet and one in the keyboard the tablet connects to the keyboard via a magnetic connector that makes a satisfying click as you snap them together sexy when the tablet is connected to the keyboard it uses up the keyboard battery first then the tablet s internal battery likewise when you charge it charges the tablet first then the keyboard in theory you have up to 20 hours of battery life with the type cover 2 attached i don t know about that but i do know i ve been able to use the device pretty much all day without running out of battery life one drawback is that there is no way to charge the keyboard separately while carrying the tablet around the keyboard has to be attached to the tablet in order to charge included with the tablet is a full version of office 2013 including word excel powerpoint outlook and onenote this allows you to do 34 real work 34 if your work involves using any of these applications you can use these applications on the 34 desktop 34 side or the 34 tablet 34 side basically you have two different home screens you can look at the mobile screen with the tiles this is the one i use the most or an interface that looks more like a traditional windows desktop there are actually separate versions of the office applications depending on which interface you re using the ones on the desktop side are more full featured but i find myself using the tablet interface for most things unfortunately there is no way to install other windows desktop programs you would need a surface pro for that but you can install apps on the 34 tablet side 34 via the store have i mentioned how awesome it is to have both a touchscreen and a keyboard web browsing becomes much more intuitive and fun the downside is that now i keep trying to touch the screen of my windows 7 laptop which of course doesn t do anything the form factor of this device is ideal the screen is large enough for comfortable reading and viewing but the whole thing is so small and light even with the type cover attached that i can easily slip it into my bag for the day as a result i have the device with me all the time it s the device i go to first now for most uses this is also the device that got me using onenote learn to use onenote it s practical and surprisingly fun pros excellent form factor good battery life office 2013 affordablecons type cover 2 keyboard must be purchased separately no app to watch amazon prime video can t install windows desktop applications
