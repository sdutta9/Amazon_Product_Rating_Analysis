so after living with the freezes the audio pops and issues waking from sleep mode i finally got cheesed off because location services weren t working and cortana wouldn t recognise the microphone resetting now but seems like it s stuck at 6 it s been at this point for nearly an hour i know others on here have implied they ve got more than 8 hours battery life but even with the screen dimmed to 25 the surface only lasted around 3 hours tonight before i had enough i really love the surface when it works but it has too many issues and i m seriously considering taking it back for a refund a laptop that costs nearly a grand with type cover shouldn t be this borked microsoft should have seriously fixed all these issues before launch they ve really put me off to the point where i m tempted to go and look at the ipad pro instead
