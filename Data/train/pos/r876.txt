please read the dialog on this cmputer before spending 1500 i loved the computer when i bought for all the reasons stated i got the i7 with 256 capacity size screen style weight capability but after installing security and basic software and using only abut five times the wireless internet cards stopped working and the display started blacking out something is really wrong with this computer the dell support was not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not helpful and after an hour starting with having me try and test online when i had no internet access he said i needed to carve out 8hrs to schedule dell support to come to my house and replace the hardware no thanks so disappointed i thought i had found my perfect computer
