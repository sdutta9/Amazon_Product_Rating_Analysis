after a year of dealing with my piece of crap hp laptop cheapest one i could find at walmart save yourself the pain don t buy it i needed to find myself a new laptop i have a refurbished dell inspiron with an xp system that i use for gaming and it works beautifully so i wanted to find a newer dell for school and everyday use praise god i found this one the laptop itself is in pristine condition and is installed with windows 8 1 and it runs my biggest complaint about my cheap hp was that it would run slowly and the internet would freeze at random so to have a laptop that runs at a very fast speed is an absolute joy i can also type much faster on the internet which i couldn t on my other laptop this laptop came with a charger and battery and is well worth every penny i paid for it if you re looking for a good laptop to use for school work or everyday do yourself a favor and buy this little baby
