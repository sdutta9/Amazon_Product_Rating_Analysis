this is overall a good laptop performs very fast i can have 20 browsers open and it still doesn t slowdown and the laptop doesn t get hot even when watching movies in high definition also the waves maxx radio is great very precise sounds physically the laptop is sturdy and the keyboard is made of extremely high quality materials finger stains are really easy to clean up and the silver finish adds to the aesthetics the full hd 1080p is also a plus of this laptop pros touchscreen full hd 1080p lots of ram great audio good quality materials very sturdy excellent dell support glossy screen cons the battery life is very short just basic web browsing barely got me 4 hours on a full charge with netflix and some youtube videos i was struggling to have it last 2 hours on a full charge i expected the battery on a modern laptop with these specs will give me at least 7 to 8 hours the price is extremely high for an i5 laptop
