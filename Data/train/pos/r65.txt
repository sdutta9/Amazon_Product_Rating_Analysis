i love my window s surface 2 i bought this to use instead of a larger heavier laptop because being a teacher i have enough to carry all the time the surface was the perfect substitute it does everything a laptop does just on a smaller scale sometimes it s a little difficult to create powerpoints and documents because it is smaller but i ve never run into major issues it produces great sound i love how the apps work on the tablet i love the keyboard hook up i purchased along with the surface so i can type using a keyboard instead the keyboard on the surface itself is also very effective and accurate i love it all around such an awesome device and people are always asking me what i have again i m very satisfied with this purchase
