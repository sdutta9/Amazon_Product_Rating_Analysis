i had bought the surface pro and returned it not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not because i didn t like it but if microsoft had updated the camera and included the new office software i would have kept it i returned it for the surface 2 because of the price the new updates to the camera and the added office software i also bought the keyboard which i am typing with right now i have the 16 gig surface and i added a micro sd card my surface 2 is very lightweight to carry and i take it to work with me everyday i love the camera and video which is hybrid you can take stills while video taping the panorama camera is great this is a great buy and it works very fast just like my computer
