the pros first easy to set up a breeze the keyboard is very comfortable the keys being separated and in my opinion easier to type with than most laptops or at least the toshibas i have been buying over the last several years the speakers for a laptop are better than good but than again anything is better than what toshiba provides in terms of sound quality alas that my friends is where the pro list ends at least thus far in the few hours i have been playing around with it for 400 bucks come on dell and throw 8 gigs of ram in there instead of 4 the boot up time is obscenely long the brightness of the screen is unacceptable being way too dark even at its highest setting the speed of the amd chip is noticeably slower than a comparable priced intel chip hp has a very similarly equipped model at best buy for 329 70 bucks cheaper and i am fairly certain that this morning is was 299 on amazon but now shows 342 battery life is below average the computer feels cheaply made and my guess is it isn t built to last for 400 dollars you can do way better than what this computer has to offer i feel bad giving this such a low rating when i got it for free through amazon vine but you want the truth right look elsewhere and get more for your money
