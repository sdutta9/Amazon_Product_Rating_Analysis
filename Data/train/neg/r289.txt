this review is for the 13 700 series i734 7143slv sometimes they change model numbers or place reviews for different computers on one style of computer which i ve always found confusing wow this is amazing this is only my first day with it and i will update if anything changes i m quite the novice when it comes to computers i use them mainly for reading social media work big user of word and lately watching more and more videos this shipped 34 clean 34 meaning there was no bloatware or games with it windows defender was the only security program it came with it comes with windows 8 1 and gives you the option of upgrading automatically to windows 10 when it releases the keys are backlit i love this so you can easily see them in low light if you don t use them for awhile they will go dark but as soon as you touch them bam they light up i had a free trial of microsoft office from my hp book and i was able to install copy that to this computer by logging into my windows account i m still not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not 100 sure how the cloud works and i keep most of my photos videos on my oldest computer which does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not have office installed only word 2010 after adding the office apps my hard drive said i had 203 free of 229gb the computer folds so you can use it as a tablet and then you can 34 tent 34 it without needed a cover like ipad needs cover inorder to tent it if you want to watch movies or give presentations 2 3 0 usb ports and one 2 0 along with cardreader slots and hdmi port there is a little pen stylus that is hides in a little built in slot and you simply press it to 34 pop 34 it out when you want to write with it i m still learning my way having been an evernote user with my ipad i ve been told onenote is probably even better than evernote now so i did a bit of playing around with it and it will take some getting used to it recognized my wifi printer right away the fan does work alot and the bottom of the laptop does get warm i have been working on it since it arrived though battery life told me 9 hours and that was about 6 hours ago now it says 2 5 hours to go but i was also streaming a tv show by the way i thought the sound using head phones was amazing outstanding i tried the same tv show in my ipad and i do have to say it was a bit more colorful and crisper but the sound on the dell was movie theater experience was using philips headphones it had this 34 fresh paint 34 app where you can sort of photo shop photos it s cute but it doesn t really explain how to actually do it i have noticed when using chrome to go online the arrow on the track pad doesn t show up when i use explorer there is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not problem prior to this computer i was using a dell inspiron 14r that is very old i had major problems with that computer however it was within the first year had to ship it our twice to dell they repaired and it has worked great since i am a fan of dell because they did make it right we have an ipad 2 usually it mostly for reading videos we have a cheap hp stream netbook that we bought strictly as a backup for word documents but somehow it s ended up being used with hdmi cable to watch free streaming sites it feels sturdy i love the touch screen though it s easy to forget you have it it does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not have a cd dvd burner player but it seems most no longer do try to keep track of your stylus they see very easy to lose all in all if i was testing this in a store i would have bought it at the price listed so far i love it love it love it
