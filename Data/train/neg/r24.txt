took a little bit longer than expected to receive also i was expecting a new out of the box surface but instead i received no paperwork whatsoever for the product it didn t have the protective film on the screen has a good inch long scratch luckily its not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not on the screen and there is a pretty bad dent on one of the corners i haven t had any problem with the battery and overall i m happy with the product itself however o do wish i just spent a little more money on the new surface 3
