i was fortunate to be a grand prize winner of the surface 2 and i love it i won this without the keyboard so i use this as a pure tablet i love being able to have two apps open side by side i usually use the facebook app or email app with the ie internet explorer browser taking up most of the screen i probably would have given this 4 stars because when i play spotify through the modern ui version of ie browser and go to another screen the music stops however i figured out that i could use the desktop version of ie and it will play spotify without stopping when i switch apps i also like the fact that it stays connected with my windows 8 1 laptop i can view pictures from my laptop on my surface with pictures app unfortunately the photos app was not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not showing my local pictures at first so i just went to the file explorer and added the local pictures folder to the pictures library then my photos app was able to see the local pictures i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not sure if the average person would know to do that though but i figured it out so it s great for me i love the how the kickstand has two different positions because sometimes the 1st position is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not good for the position i m in at the moment microsoft was very smart to add that feature to the surface 2 so great job microsoft at making a really good 2nd generation surface i hope this is a good indicator that your 3rd generation is going to be even more awesome
