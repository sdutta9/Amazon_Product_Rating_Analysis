so i bought this for college mind you asked my advisor if this thing would last and he said yes it will last you one program gives it some problems but other than that your fine so here i am well let s get started i will say do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not buy this if your looking to use it for engineering during college i m in computer programming yes it s part of the engineering field and i m already having problems and i m already at 75 to 80 ram usage while the cpu is at 90 mind you this is along with having one chrome tab open while listening to music on youtube it s lagging taking 1 5 minutes to respond and show what i typed up and the music staggers while coding so engineers do yourself a favor and get a surface pro the surface 3 is too weak and it s max ghz is 1 6 don t get fooled by the 2 4ghz boost which is supposably in there there is no mode for high performance and boost activates by default as intel states also i d like to point out that i do have it plugged in so simply with that it should activate again get yourself a surface pro and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a surface 3 i d recommend a pro 4 with i5 and 8gb ram so that your worry free of the issue i m experiencing now for those who aren t using this stuff for engineering that demands power this thing is certainly for you record lectures take notes on one note and record audio during note taking and even take high quality pictures if you need extra stuff on it no worries it s a full os unlike apples ipad office works great on this device with absolutly no problems i can have up to 15 tabs open on chrome when i m researching for my english class alongside having youtube play some music and 3 word documents up and i m still doing just fine no lag or skips what so ever is present allowing me to do what i need kind of above is reason this surface is great for those who aren t really going into a high end demanding field like me don t let others tell you it works in that field because it won t other than that this device has no issues with me i can surf the web install small games low demanding games which i don t have on it but you know what the game demands if you put steam on it microsd card slot to expand my storage along with a usb port and etc just because i can t do one thing doesn t make this a horrible device i should have researched deeper than simply asking my college advisor if it ll do that s my fault not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the surface 3 do i recommend this device absolutly with a free year of office365 if available still the device does a lot for it s price touch pen support on a level like no other and a full os battery lasts an everage of 7 hours loweing the brightness when it isn t needed will give you more battery a lot more
