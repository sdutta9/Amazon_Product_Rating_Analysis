worked great for eight weeks even though i used it maybe 20 times right before a major road trip where i needed it for presentations it simply stopped working although the microsoft rep tried to help fix the problem he said the unit had to be replaced and they would send a new one that would arrive in two to three days which didn t help because i was about to leave for the airport thank god i still had my mac i don t know why i every thought about switching oh yea microsoft claimed surface 2 was better than a mac not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not in my opinion update 2 to 3 day replacement that microsoft promised where is it i m now on day 6 and waiting i would lower my rating to zero stars if it were an option
