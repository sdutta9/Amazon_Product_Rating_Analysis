i have been using this laptop for a few weeks now i have to say it is a screaming deal for 349 what i paid for it 1080p display plus a real core i3 for 349 find another 15 6 34 laptop in this price range with a core i3 and a 1080p display i can t find one the hard drive is slow and is the single biggest annoyance it also is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not designed to be customer replaced it can be but you have to open up the whole computer including removing the keyboard to do it it is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not for the novice but following youtube videos i was able to get it done boots up from cold in just seconds very lightweight fast and runs all windows 10 software nicely office 2013 acrobat quickbooks etc note this is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a gaming machine i ve tried a few games and they really don t perform oh sure it ll play basic web browser games it ll play some of the windows app store games but don t plan on playing battlefield or call of duty on this the gpu can t cut it but for 349 for a basic windows 10 machine well worth the purchase price note while the hdd is hard to replace with a ssd the ram is easy it can take a 8gb ddr3 sodimm stick in the bottom for a total max of 12gb of ram
