this is a great tablet that gets even better when paired with the type cover and the microsoft surface 3 stylus it came with windows 10 which was great i didn t have to download the upgrade i purchased and installed office 2013 on this unit and even without it being the surface pro 3 it has plenty of juice to run the software i also like the fact that it allows multiple windows and you can size them where you want this device has you covered from all angles whether you want to browse the web need to type up a report or take down notes with the stylus and have them converted to text i use it for everything from reading e books to using vpn and rdp to log into my desktop at work
