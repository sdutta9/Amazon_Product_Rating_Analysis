so on most levels i love this laptop it has all the features i wanted the speed is good it does everything i need tech support is great however i have had this laptop 9 months and have just had to replace the hard drive twice since it s still under warranty it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a biggie call dell they run some diagnostics overnight me a new hard drive i put it in but 2 times in nine months once the warranty elapses and the hard drive goes again as i have every reason to expect it will i ll be looking for something else oh yes also recently when i plug in the power cord it tells me the power adapter device cannot be determined it s the one that came with the laptop it then won t charge until i unplug replug it in a few 3 5 maybe 10 times so a few months since my last review and the problems continue i did discover by accident that changing to a 90v charger solved the charger problem no problems for about a month but now here we go again having trouble booting up sometimes i get a gray screen and the laptop makes a popping noise i ran a diagnostic which i know all about from past experience and was told nothing was wrong i eventually found that removing and reinstalling the battery helps most of the time then the past few days i was getting an error that windows wasn t activated tried to activate it no luck last night i contacted microsoft because my office 365 was also not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not working got a licensing error they spent about an hour checking things un and re installing no luck they did tell me that for 149 they could try and fix it money back if they couldn t at this point though i am so fed up with this thing i am not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not spending another nickel will use it until it dies again which i believe is inevitable i have office on my notebook so i can use that if i need to in all fairness all of my work issued laptops i get a new one every 3 years have been dells and i ve never had problems with them but this one is the devil
