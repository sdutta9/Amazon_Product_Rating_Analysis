this is my review as a student and an avid windows 7 fan first of all this is a great piece of hardware and i would love the pro4 if it wasn t for the hulking dump of crap that is microsoft software windows 10 office etc here is what happens every time i have 1 hour to study something 1 take the surface out of my bag and push the power button wait 5 6 minutes for it to boot up even though i never turned it off 2 spend 10 20 minutes trouble shooting my internet connection and in general deal with the s ty wifi connection even when i have full bars as i can literally see the wifi router 3 try to figure out why microsoft word powerpoint or note are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not starting up even though the task is running in the manager 4 put the surface back in my bag and use the lab computer this should not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not be the case if i paid 1200 for a machine
