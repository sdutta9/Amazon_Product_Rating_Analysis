i am real pleased with the product for the price it is a very wide laptop and that is good for the keyboard but it is almost two large to fit in my satchel the keyboard keys have more play than many laptops but it is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not as much as a regular desktop keyboard and i and it is taking me a bit longer than expected to get accustomed to the feel of it overall i like it and for the money it is perfect for a classroom paper writing workstation i would definitely purchase it again
