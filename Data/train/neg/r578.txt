when you buy a laptop at this price point you re probably fully aware of what you re getting and what you re not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not getting for instance this this particular asus laptop you re not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not getting the best quality screen but quite honestly for casual computing movies and such it looks great and there are some other things you may be missing out on comparing it to a ips retina display of course and it s going to lose but you could have a pile of these for the price of something with a retina display another example is the memory you get 4gb soldered onto the motherboard while this was fine for the casual web browsing movie watching and office style applications i had an extra 4gb put it in and now at 8gb it s that much better and an easy upgrade the case isn t the most durable thing in the world but you can get a case for it so for the price point what are you getting an excellent laptop with a good looking screen perhaps enough but easily upgradeable ram a dvd burner video out via vga those old 15 pin connectors that nobody should be using anymore and hdmi really you re getting everything including a great albeit 34 budget 34 processor in the i3 which is still more powerful than other processors out there but yes it is lacking some things the hard disc is the old magnetic not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not ssd and sluggish 5400rpm the dvd reads and writes dvds and cds but it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not bluray for what you get and even what you don t get in this machine it s a great machine for a good price from a reputable company i wouldn t have much hesitation for most casual users including heavy tablet users that actually want a better 34 computing 34 experience and keyboard and more flexibility and size of course built in high school and college students at least those not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not taking computing intensive courses like graphic design video editing and or computer science should find this machine more than meets their needs all in all a very nice machine that i d recommend
