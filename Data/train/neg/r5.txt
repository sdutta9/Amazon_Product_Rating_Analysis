purchased this machine trying to save a bit of money thinking it should be just as good as the surface 3 wrong my husband has the 3 this one arrived literally 3 hours ago the first problem i experienced was that after selecting 34 make this a new pc 34 it automatically linked with my desk top and configured it as such note i did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not want it configured to my desktop it also gave an option to configure to the desktop which i did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not select the second thing i noticed was that after about 20 minutes the battery wouldn t charge at first i thought maybe it was dead and needed some time but it never charged i tried looking through the settings thinking maybe i needed to turn it on or something wrong again it turns out that many of the surface 2 s have an issue with the drivers that operate the battery i was not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not about to go through an hour of bs to try and get this thing to function the way should after freshly opening this new device needless to say i was pissed i don t understand why microsoft continues to sell these surface 2 if they are experiencing these types of problems fresh out the box i m thinking of ordering the surface 3 but i think i ll wait to make sure my husband doesn t experience any glitches with it first beware of the surface 2
