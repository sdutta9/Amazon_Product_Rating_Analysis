recently my laptop broke and while considering replacement options i thought why not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a tablet so i did some research and the recently released surface 2 seemed like the best option it has a usb port which was a big deal for me word excel and a desktop mode that looks just like a regular computer this really is a nice tablet great screen nice weight size good speakers but this is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a laptop replacement for me at least all i need for a computer is internet word excel powerpoint and a fast operating system and the thing is i can purchase a laptop with all of that for less than the surface 2 a 450 price tag as well as 120 on the touch cover keyboard is pretty steep for this device and after a week using it i will be sending it back to microsoft so overall this is a very good tablet a bit overpriced would be fine if the 120 keyboard was included and definitely not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a laptop replacement if you really want a tablet and are willing to spend this much money there are options that are just as good for almost half the price then this is the tablet for you
