you will like it if you mainly use it as a laptop i dose all the job that a pc can do and it s extremely portable which is why i liked it however i experienced multiple issues when i use it as a tablet 1 the camera is terrible i have to stay still for about 10 seconds until it can finally focus and take the photo and there s a lot of glitches during video shooting 2 the pen is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not very smooth 3 had some other issues during web browsing
