i bought a surface dropped it from a very low height and it completely cracked so first up the product is very flimsily created read all the other reviews on this subject area if you are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not planning on sitting on a couch with this device or having it encased in a bulky protector go with a more solidly created product next ever since i cracked it days ago i ve been trying to speak with any person from microsoft who could even tell me if it s possible to get it fixed it s been days and days and days and i cannot even get close to any communication from a human no phone no email no text the only support options are logging onto their website but if you don t have account info they will not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not let you through to get customer support and guess where my account info is in the device that is broken and so because my device is broken i cannot get support to fix it see how that works so the product might be fine as long as it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not broken but if it s broken you get no service i ve been on the phone for 40 minutes now nothing i give companies like asus a lot of credit they have live operators that immediately pick up the phone and help not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not at all so with microsoft here i sit on the phone it will probably be days before the finally tell me 34 we re sorry sir your device is broken and because it s broken we cannot help you 34 oh wait here someone finally picked up 42 minutes later
