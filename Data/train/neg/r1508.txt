i have purchased several used laptops over the past few years all totaling in cost less than what a new one would cost i ve had very good luck with two prior to this one you get a few surprises such as my spell check was in french and i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not french but for the most part i ve been very happy i m disabled so i stay on the computer all day every day i have 3 lap dogs that stay on me too they had knocked a couple of my keys off of the keyboard with their nails and i had a couple of hints that the motherboard might be getting ready to die so time to replace it i won t by a new one because i hate the newer operating system they come with so i ordered another used one it arrived and seems to be fine but the letters are worn on several of the keys it s an issue with me because i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a typest and have to visually see what i m typing really how much could it have possibly cost to replace a few keys oh when you start your windows you have to put the product key numbers in it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not on the copy of the cd they send you but on a microscopic stamp taped to the bottom of the computer you have to get a magnifying glass turn the computer upside down write the number down and go from there think they could have stuck it on the cd for convience
