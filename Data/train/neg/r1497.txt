i received my latitude with a 2 2 ghz cpu and 2 gigs of ram a week after i ordered it right out of the box it started up fine and the battery lasted for 6 hours the only obvious sign of wear was on the bottom side i loaded a 3d cad program onto it and it performs great and runs cool that is exactly why i love a laptop with xp also included was a dvd rw drive and all for the lowest price on the net i have also received a monitor stand and d port replicator from amazon and everything works fine i will be buying refurbished from now on as new computers simply aren t worth the money
