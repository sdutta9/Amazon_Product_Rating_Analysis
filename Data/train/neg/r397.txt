i think the market for this is someone who wants a tablet and notebook all in one which is exactly how they market it so no surprise there however with that said just note that it doesn t do either thing as well as a dedicated tablet or notebook i had the surface pro 3 for a month last year before returning it at the last moment as i just couldn t justify the cost and i think i might end up doing the same thing here however i have a ton of computers and tablets so that is certainly a big factor however the main huge factor is i also ended up getting an ipad pro and that is fantastic and makes me pretty much never pick up the surface this doesn t mean the surface is bad it s excellent it s just not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not as excellent as my ipad pro or my macbook pro which is running windows 99 of the time so it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not an osx deal again however if you want only one device this is an excellent signal solution it doesn t do anything poorly but again it rarely excels at anything either more thoughts the screen is excellent it looks great gets pretty bright has good color and is fairly accurate on the color the pen is very good but not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not excellent compared to the ipad pro with the apple pencil the pen on the surface is fairly slow to respond i mean the vast majority of people won t really know it but if you re using it for art or design there isn t quite enough precision to replace a wacom but i d put it on par with wacom s cheapest offerings like a bamboo if you re just using it to take notes it should work well enough the other note is windows it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not always fun to use with the pen using this with photoshop can be frustrating as windows often will think you re swiping in from the edges etc hopefully it s something ms can take care of in future windows updates speed is quite good but remember this is a dual core mobile processor it s no slouch but it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not going to keep up with a non compact notebook in the same price range 8gb of ram is fine but seriously it s 2015 almost 2016 windows 10 does a great job with lower ram requirements but this should have 16gb of ram at this price level that would make me feel a lot better about keeping this a few years 256gb ssd is again fine but again i d hope for more at the price range but i ll take an ssd anyday over a larger non ssd so i guess it will do but anyone can look up the prices of drives and you ll know there isn t a 400 price difference between a 256 and a 512gb drive the performance of the drive is pretty snappy no complaints there form factor is good but this goes back to it being a jack of all trades somehow this without the keyboard is supposed to weigh the same as the ipad pro yet if you hold both you d swear the ipad pro is lighter and quite a bit lighter if you re comparing this to a tablet this is quite large still and since you have a fan in there it can get a bit loud this isn t a big deal and rarely happens but just something to keep in mind if you think you re getting a true tablet it s the price you pay for having a full pc in your hands personally i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a huge fan of holding the surface it feels great but it feels like if you dropped it more than a foot it would shatter that is most likely not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the case but it feels very dense and thus dropping it feels like it would be a big deal if you re comparing it to a notebook then this is an excellent size but while the new keyboard is a huge upgrade over the surface pro 3 keyboard it s still not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not up to par with a decent notebook keyboard again it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not bad at all just not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not excellent overall it probably sounds like i m bashing the surface more than i actually intend i really do like it and if i had to choose to either get a tablet or a notebook then i d get this since it does both but i d much rather have a proper notebook and a full on tablet purchased this at a chain store so it won t say verified but i did indeed purchase it
