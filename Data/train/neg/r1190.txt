i ll start off by saying this is my replacement laptop the first one i received was extremely slow i spent a half a day with dell tech support doing troubleshooting then a soft reset then a hard reset he offered to send me a usb containing a software reinstall i decided i didn t want to get stuck with a lemon and returned it for an exchange as a side note i could not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not get my pop based email account to work in the windows mail app i could get it to receive the emails but then i couldn t open them anyway i received the new one and it s faster it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not lightning fast but tolerable my old asus should have been slower spec wise but wasn t i m sure there are programs i ll be needing to delete mcafee was the first to go i much prefer avg in this new laptop i still could not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not get my email account loaded so i called dell and they wanted to charge me 129 00 for software support to help me with this issue i then called my isp and they wanted to transfer me to home tech support for 99 00 i ended up installing windows essentials windows live email for free and it worked great it seems outlook works well for some email servers but not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not for pop same with the advanced email set up option in windows mail pop was one of the choices but good luck getting it to work i have a feeling there are still a few bugs to work out with windows 10 but i m happy that at least i was able to install a few programs apache windows essentials to make it all work still a better deal than the macs
