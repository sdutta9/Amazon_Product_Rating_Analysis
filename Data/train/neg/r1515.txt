i purchased one of these laptops from link tronics memory through amazon to replace a laptop my grandmother had that she lost in a wildfire in texas she loved it but more importantly she took it to her computer guy and he said it was an excellent computer better than any refurbished computer he sold then i purchased one for my sister who has wanted a laptop for a while finally i purchased one for my teenage son for christmas what i was thrilled about these little laptops is that they came loaded and tweaked almost exactly how i would done in all honesty i was prepared with my os disc and drivers and programs to reformat but there was no need to do so the performance of these laptops has far superseded an xps gaming laptop that was given to me a couple years ago it s an old model but that should still say something about the dell latitude d630 it s slim and has a nice profile to it easy to carry with you if you don t have a case i have refurbished several of our old computers over the years so my advice to those that have had a bad experience with this laptop is that they are refurbished when companies refurbish a computer they go through and test to see what needs replaced and they replace it or fix it wipe the drive or stick a new one in maybe clean it up a bit and you have a refurbished computer considering the age of the model there are surely things that will wear out or break much sooner than you would expect from a brand new computer the lids keyboards mouse buttons and whatnot are guaranteed to have some wear and scratches it may or may not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not arrive looking sparkly and new buying refurbished most likely means that calling the manufacturer will do no good for support as it is no longer under their warranty purchasing a refurbished one should expect these things and set their expectations accordingly it is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a brand new computer all in all the dell latitude d630 is a nice little working computer it makes a perfect gift for kids or anyone that just wants a decent laptop but not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not want to spend a fortune the price is good too i ve looked for months for something and found this to be the best bargain i would definitely recommend this laptop
