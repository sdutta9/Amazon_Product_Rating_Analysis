my last laptop was a dell so it s only natural that i would purchase another dell laptop well i haven t even had this computer for two full weeks and i m already wanting to smash it with a hammer as soon as i got it i upgraded to windows 10 i ve had problems with this laptop since it just froze on me earlier and made a buzzing sound i had to unplug it and take out the battery to get it to shut off it wouldn t restart last night i had to do the same thing the windows key won t always bring up the windows menu the windows menu doesn t always want to show up the sound like to drop for no reason no matter what i do to try and stop it this is one of the worst laptops i ve ever had in my life i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not saying i won t ever buy another dell laptop but i certainly won t buy this piece of crap again
