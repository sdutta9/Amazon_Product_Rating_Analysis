out of the box the first one wouldn t boot it was stuck in automatic repairs hell none of the options to restore or reset it worked i exchanged it and the second one worked for about an hour and now has the same issue too bad it seemed like a good piece of hardware and filled a niche i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not going to risk having the same issue after weeks or months of use when it has my docs and content on it though can t trust it
