the dell inspiron i3541 is a low powered laptop computer it has a large crisp screen and is fairly thin though heavy the product design is minimal and sleek the black plastic case is accented with a brushed aluminum cover the touchpad and full sized keyboard are both responsive and work well for the average user this dell laptop will provide sufficient computing power to accomplish daily tasks and entertainment it s a great choice if you re only looking for basic use inexpensive durable and fairly reliable this is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a high powered gaming computer and for computing intensive work you re likely to be disappointed by its slowness i ve been using it consistently to write on and conduct research for this kind of task it s perfect and the screen size lets me view pages side by side without sacrificing visibility and word processing and document access never lag or freeze
