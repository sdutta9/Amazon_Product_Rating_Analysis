it is undoubtedly a capable small machine which everybody have found out but that said there are some defects some pretty serious i have 1920 1080 no gloss no touch screen which is pretty good but still it is small thus i prefer to use an external monitor at home or as quite a few hotels now have full hd on the hotel television 1 my home screen is a 4k 40 34 samsung television the display is excellent with the xps 13 now it took quite some efforts and costs to get there i also bought the so called docking station more about later only the display port outputs 4k thus i bought and an adapter dp to hdmi wrong the dell and the adapter don t seem to speak to each other it took some efforts to get contact with a capable engineer but finally i succeeded 2 an active adapter is necessary thus i bought one an active 4k dp to hdmi successful excellent picture but why doesn t dell informs that before the purchase or at least together with the unit note an active adapter is quite more expensive than a passive 3 i also bought a passive adapter mini dp the output on the computer to dp my idea was to use it via the previous active dp to hdmi adapter to the television successful and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not only that i could remove the active adapter and only use the passive mini dp to dp adapter and a dp to hdmi cable i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not quite sure what happened but i think the active adapter was necessary to change some driver but still better support from dell would be appreciated 4 i also bought a mini dp to vga adapter mainly for use on hotel televisions this only gives full hd not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not 4k but that is sufficient it works 5 the docking station is in my view a disaster the usp ports on a laptop especially where there are only two get quite a lot of wear and tear from uses on the lap in airplanes in a hurry in terminal ans so on at home you have the docking station if this is a real docking station it has some sort of fixture into which the laptop snaps precisely little wear and and tear and to this ds everything is connected nothing needs to be connected to the computer 6 not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not so the dell docking station it connects to one of the scarce usb ports the laptop still needs to be connected to a current outlet as needs the ds thus two current adapters quite a lot of hassle and wear and tear on the poor usb ports but there are more ports usb hdmi dp ethernet unfortunately the hdmi doesn t give 4k curious as i have not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not yet seen a television set with dp a dedicated monitor yes but price wise a large television beats a monitor and in my experience a 32 34 screen is the smallest one you should use for 4k 7 there are a lot of usb ports and in a ds there should be no space problems nice as many usb items take more than their allotted space not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not so in the dell ds the three usb 3 in the front a are crammed together probably to give space to the displaylink sticker 8 the dell ds is advertised as compatible with any computer with a usb port a quick try with my desktop wasn t successful with 4k full hd well talk about see paint drying but i was in no mood to experiment with various settings 9 taken into consideration the few usb ports it is curious that dell doesn t deliver a bluetooth keyboard mouse combo as i have had some bad experience with such combos it would be nice to have a bluetooth combo delivered or at least tested and certified by dell 10 the xps now has an sd port but the sd card doesn t enter entirely into the port about a centimeter protrudes if you forget it could easily be damage during travelling 11 the xps 13 is delivered in an absolutely excellent case if weight but not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not space is your primary concern then use it while travelling it gives the laptop a good protection but you have to remove the sd card and the keyboard mouse receiver they can however be placed below the laptop in the case 12 the verdict if a small lightweight laptop is all you need then xps 13 is a gem but if you want to connect it to other items the question is if not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a better equipped laptop beats xps 13 with additional items ds adapters mouse keyboard cables etc
