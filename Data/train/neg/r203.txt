i bought a surface 2 from my local microsoft store and absolutely love it i had the previous generation and this is an amazing improvement the kickstand has two angles now and the second angle makes it much easier to use in your lap the surface 2 is also only made with two pieces versus three since the last generation resulting in a more solid feeling device the silver magnesium is so good looking and so is the screen full 1080p resolution resulting in more crisp pictures and breathtaking movie visuals the sound is good not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the best but much better than the first generation the cameras on the surface 2 are vastly improved since the last generation so if you re one that s particular on a tablet with a good camera surface 2 will be able to fulfill that the surface 2 comes with windows 8 1 which is also an improvement in itself of course it comes with microsoft office 2013 rt which includes outlook onenote word powerpoint and excel also i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not sure if it s because i bought my surface 2 from a microsoft store but it came with codes for 200gb of free skydrive storage for 2 years and 1 year of unlimited skype minutes and wifi which in my opinion is such a great value especially since the skydrive storage that can be used across all your windows devices associated with your microsoft account in conclusion if you re looking for a tablet that can not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not only meet your productivity needs office and has great battery life for consumption look no further than the surface 2
