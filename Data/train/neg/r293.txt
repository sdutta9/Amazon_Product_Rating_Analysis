very fast and customizable laptop i have only had this laptop for two weeks here are my pros and cons pros lightweight for a laptop looks very clean and professional responsive touchscreen converts to a tablet quickly fast for streaming videos and using multiple programs at the same time beautiful screen colors hd etc 3 usb slots very comfortable to use smooth finish good keyboard good design overall runs apps and programs smoothly speakers are very impressive for such a small laptop beats out my old 15 6inch laptop that had harmon kardon speakers cons heavy for a tablet when changing from tablet to laptop sometimes the mouse will disappear i will have to shut the computer off and turn it on again to get the mouse back if this happens the first week i have the laptop will it only get worse as time goes on trackpad is different than any other trackpad i have used before takes about a full day or two to get used to it it is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not bad once you get used to it the trackpad is also not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not very sensitive to small movements which can be frustrating the screen leaks light out around the edges it is only noticeable in a dark environment microsoft store is junk a lot of preloaded apps that don t have any utility update 6 30 15 the volume button on he side of the laptop is uncomfortable to press in you basically have to use your the tip of your fingernail the button is also put on backwards the minus sign increases the volume and the plus sign decreases the volume but it is easy to get used to it has been couple of more weeks with the laptop and i still really enjoy it i would really recommend this laptop for someone who is just using it for basic browsing streaming games etc main points track pad takes some getting used to but the beauty and performance of the laptop makes up for it
