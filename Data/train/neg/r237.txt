i was a touch screen resistant pc user and this is my first experience with a tablet except playing with friends ipad and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not liking it much heaving read all the negative reviews below and decided to buy it anyway because of office being pre installed and the full size usb port after testing it for a few days i can confirm that it has some flaws but overall it serves my purpose now the keypad finally arrived i can start working before that everything seemed to take twice as long as normal may be a user problem although it offers some clever ways of inputting data in excel sheets and i ve finally warmed up to some touch screen features main reasons for only 3 stars the link to a microsoft account to sign in and to use skype is very annoying uploading photos via usb from my camera works reasonably well but editing them is very limited picasa does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not seem to work downloading picasa hd free version comes with advertising lets you see your existing albums but no editing functions basic fb entries work but i m having ongoing problems when trying to upload multiple photos to facebook seems to take only 1 or 2 at a time if lucky have not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not found any interesting apps yet if anybody found a way to download google chrome please let me know does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not at work outdoors way too much glare screen works like a mirror overall being a totally non tech person i found the set up and customization replacing all the unwanted bing apps on the start screen with my favorites fairly easy and straightforward microsoft s online chat has been helpful on a few issues i ve encountered in the process after waking up to a dark screen battery can drain in deep sleep mode over night even if you don t notice low battery indicator before it only shows on the desktop page or lockout screen takes 3 4h to fully charge and even more if using it while charging
