purchased the surface to use around the house as a web browser and media streaming device and wanted long battery life having ms office was an added bonus but wasn t planning on using it to write or edit documents for the most part the surface met my expectations except for streaming video had problems using ie11 with flash support video using the netflix app was fine but when using ie to stream amazon or hbo go the video and audio had noticeable stutter and eventually would stop after several minutes applied all updates with no improvement other devices on the same network didn t have the problem interestingly ms doesn t have a version of silverlight for rt recommended playback option for amazon rather than flash so there wasn t any other option to try for streaming no other browsers can be installed either no app for amazon or hbo go decided to return the tablet rather than help ms debug it maybe the surface 3 will have basic video streaming worked out beyond the streaming problems the tablet is responsive and works quite well the metro version of ie is a bit cumbersome and sluggish but serviceable the desktop version is better ms office seems to work well application launching and switching works great kickstand is very useful when sitting at a table but not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not on the lap natural landscape orientation really requires two hands which can be a bit awkward screen is bright and clear on screen keyboard works well didn t purchase the type or touch cover
