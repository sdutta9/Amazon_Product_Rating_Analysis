previously posted a good review on this and i stand by what i said it functions well however the hinges were too tight and one fell off the screen is now separated and according to the manufacturer 34 physical damage 34 my fault or not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not voids the one year warranty it comes with still a good computer but i recommend springing for the protection plan or buying it from best buy which has a better protection plan because the cost of fixing this one little thing is equal to the cost of the computer
