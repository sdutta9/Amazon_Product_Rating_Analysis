i found one of these used and in pretty much pristine condition so i bit it does work very well and would work far better if not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not for the lock down hardware architecture however that is part of the package and after doing more research i completely understand why it is done the way it is the upside to this is that it should be immune to viruses malware and trojans it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not immune to adware since many of the apps in the microsoft app store are riddled with adverts it s very fast user friendly and hardware feature rich once i reset it and let it reinstall windows it connected to my wifi accepted my ms account and smooth sailing from there on battery life is very good so far for basic tasks i have found the necessities in the ms app store only one threw adverts at me and it was promptly yanked
