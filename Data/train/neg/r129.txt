i bought the surface 2 to do course work on line there is no written documentation that accompanies it so it s hard to get started because nothing about it s operating system is intuitive i managed to watch a couple of online videos to get started on my mac i found it difficult to navigate around the desktop none the less yesterday during an automatic update one of many the surface crashed it gave me some kind of internal power error message it s completely frozen i have been unable to figure out how to repair it so for now it s a piece of electronic junk expensive junk i m going to have to take it to a microsoft store to get it unstuck talk about a big pain you know where don t buy it
