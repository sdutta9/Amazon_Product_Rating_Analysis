i got this quot laptop quot about a year ago from the very beginning the laptop had some small quirks but i didn t mind them because otherwise it worked pretty well the touchpad is pretty dismal but the keyboard isnt that bad i would definitely have a mouse the glitches included freezing up probably at least once every 2 weeks sometimes more the screen rotating into portrait mode and locking in that mode the desktop icons randomly moving and since windows 10 when put into tablet mode sometimes the keyboard won t lock while all that was frustrating it worked relativley well it had awesome storage for movies all my pictures etc and it was also extremely portable and battery was relativley good but about 2 days ago i was about to start watching some netflix when all of the sudden the screen rotated and locked in portrait mode so i tried to no avail to fix it in the settings i then proceeded to shut it down and when i tried to turn it back on it wouldn t boot yep so i took it to a repair shop and apparently the hard drive failed thank god i still have a warrenty on it just in case but as a student i have multiple applications and documents on my hard drive that were extremely inmportant that i need this weekend i am so angry about this horrid laptop and i do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not recommend buying at at any cost
