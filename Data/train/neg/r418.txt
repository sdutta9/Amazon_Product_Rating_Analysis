we bought 3 for the office fully loaded with additional warranty they works great when it s working right right of the bat i had seen several issues one of my sp4 doesn t work with the surface dock to display to 2 external monitors confirmed that the other 2 sp4 works just fine microsoft support is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not that helpful after talking to my re seller i m going to try to exchange it to the ms store and see how the process gowhen you have your type cover folded back table stand docking style you can t turn on the surface you ll get stuck at surface logo you have to fold the type cover like the laptop style to start the surface first before folding it back to put on your cubicle as of 11 16 with latest update this bug still has not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not been fixed there are random major slowdown at times that s highly unusual with laptop with ssd i m still not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not able to pinpoint what cause it i suspect either keyboard touchscreen input issue or network drives issues since our sp4 is connected to the domain windows hello is great when it s working it works about 80 of the time at times i noticed that if your camera is angled up against the ceiling light it has issue with windows hello recognition surface pen i don t really find any real business usage for the pen yeah it s neat to have but i don t use them enough for almost 2 00 touch cover dock 4yrs warranty we spent for each machine it s kind of unacceptable at the end of the days for regular user if you have no need for the pen i would go with an ultrabook for about 700 compared to spending close to 200 for this machine
