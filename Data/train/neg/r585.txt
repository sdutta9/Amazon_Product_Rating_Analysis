the hd 1080p and core i3 combined at this price is good in fact at this price factors into all the features it is comfortable to use the keyboard comes closer than most laptops i have used at feeling like a desktop keyboard that s a plus for me the numeric keypad works well the big negative to the keyboard is that there are no indicator lights for the number lock or the caps lock that is disappointing the picture is quite good and hd the sound without earphones is surprisingly strong with 4 gb and 500 gb this is plenty sizable for most home and some business use and it comes with a r w dvd i can t get it to open via the button and have to go to the file explorer and do an eject that works fine wifi works well bluetooth does as well and it easily connected wirelessly to my hp printer all of the setup went flawlessly windows 10 of course is a matter of personal taste i am getting used to it and miss windows 7 less and less a feature that asus advertises for this is the icecool feature that keeps the palm rest area of the keyboard cool i don t know that i ever noticed my hands getting hot on other laptops but this one is certainly not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not warm to the touch at all perhaps that would be most noticeable by those who type all day this certainly seems to be worth the money and has features you would expect to pay more for this would be well suited for students who are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not power users and for normal home use i am not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a gamer so i don t know how well it would work for that overall i am pleased with how this works five stars for price feature value less some for the lack of keyboard indicator lights and optical drive opener problem really 4 5 stars and i rounded up
