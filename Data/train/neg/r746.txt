i bought this for my daughter for homework learning photo editing and to do some personal movie editing the laptop meets her needs and is small enough not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not to add too much weight to her backpack so far it has met her needs and she has enjoyed it very much it is a good computer for the price and portability
