the hardware that comes with this laptop is fantastic for the price i was expecting a laptop that is somewhat bulky but it is fairly thin but not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not that thin to where you ll feel like you ll break it in your backpack i also priced out a laptop with almost similar hardware specifications which is listed here but the laptop listed above is a little more expensive than this dell so in the end i decided to give this dell my first shot i do however realize this is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the best laptop out there but the fit and finish is very nice it s completely white with black keys on the inside and black on the outside which actually looks quite nice webcam looks very clear in a well lit room haven t tested it in a dark room yet there is another simple reason to choose this laptop over other options it boots in a few seconds and you get the 1tb compactly also looking at used laptops with equivalent specifications you would be hard pressed to find a much better deal for this price with 8 gb of ram it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not terrible so for the price i will give this laptop 9 10 overall i m happy to have this laptop the drawbacks are minor and what you get for the price made it easily the best choice for me
