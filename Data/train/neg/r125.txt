1 32g hd space is a lie it says 25 3 upon install then after all the updates it starts at 18 5g that s 14g gone just by turning it on and updating 2 you can t turn off the updates so everything keeps changing and you cant stop it ever so it will eventually fill up even more space and force you to accept their changes to apps 3 you can t use more than one bluetooth device without lagging issues why sell a wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse and a wireless speaker if you can t use them together 4 you can only download new apps from their store if it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not there too bad 5 the web support lasted for 3 whole months and all they tell you to do is reboot and reinstall everything from scratch 6 geez 5 is enough
