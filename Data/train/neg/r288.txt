pros size i like it my old 17 34 xps is a wonderful device i have two 1tb ssd s in it and 16 gb of memory with an i7 processor it s a beast and fast however it s also big heavy puts out a fair amount of heat and fan noise and it not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not always convenient to lug around particularly on road trips by contrast the little 2 in 1 fits that bill quite nicely also the smaller drive forces me to think hard about how much stuff i really need to keep on my hd it s the anti packrat laptop touch screen seems to work fine for me although at 1920 x 1080 my big old fingers have to be careful about what i select the built in stylus is useful for getting around that screen 1920 x 1080 that is just about the practical limit for this little 13 34 screen i can get stuff done with this screen screens with less resolution don t appeal to me i guess i just like to sprawl keyboard quite decent touch for everyday typing nice to be able to switch between standard function keys or specialized keys volume lights etc by tapping fn esc however see note under 34 cons 34 os windows 8 1 soon to be upgraded to windows 10 around the end of this month tablet mode works well easily 34 tabletable 34 i like it adware and crapware these seem blissfully non existent on this box i know there are other companies that do install all that stuff on their consumer products leaving the end user to sort it all out dell support i have been a personal fan of dell s support site for a long time they make it easy to download drivers and get updates query the warranty status of your pc see how it was originally shipped etc this is in sharp contrast to one other major company which i will not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not name here i have had intimate familiarity with both companies on the server side for many many years and i like dell cons short battery life about 4 hours under normal usage maybe less with heavy file i o weird keyboard combinations the home end page up and page down keys require that the left hand hold down both ctrl and fn to make them work it s kind of awkward but one gets used to it might ruin me for a regular keyboard later on though i guess this is a compromise that must be made because of the smaller keyboard real estate available there is no key combination to disable the touchpad while typing however one can set the touchpad so that it will disable itself if it detects that an external mouse is attached that works for me if i remove the wireless usb for the mouse the touchpad goes active when i plug it back in the touchpad goes inactive simple enough overall i m pleased with the purchase no need to look back and for the price i paid under 700 it can t be beat
