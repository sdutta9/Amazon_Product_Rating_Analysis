it s been said in virtually every positive review of the surface 2 this is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a toy which has two sides to it don t judge the s2 for its paltry game selection or the limited number of other apps but for what surface alone can do among mobile devices work seamlessly and powerful on the office apps that you run every day this is almost cliche by now but it s true many reviewers have compared it unfavorably to smartphones for smartphone like functions and and unfavorably to laptops for windows type functions and given insufficient credit for the great value of straddling all of those functions and performing all of the essential tasks of both in form factor that looks and feels great to use and is impressively svelte in my opinion most tech reviewers are behind the curve when it comes to new device genres and the surface windows rt is just such a device office runs great and most of the saving file management behavior is just like windows this is a device you can take home or on the road every day while leaving your laptop at home where it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not like full windows 8 office excel macros yes that s about it and i feel the inconvenience of this myself sometimes but other than that the only other things missing that i know of are true power user capabilities like running third party extensions for office this is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not totally insignificant and will be important for some users but understand that all of the other normal functions are as they are in full office there are also good security rationales for these limitations in the lighter lower power rt environment that don t have loads of security software and other processes running in the background if you are used to android or ios apps you have to adjust to doing more from your browser but you realize that s as much because of the form factor this is more like a laptop than a regular tablet and internet explorer runs everything web based unlike ipads or cell phones i run a solo practice law office and the 1 use for my surface is timekeeping on my web based practice management software essentially a sophisticated website and it works great i have also set up a vpn for my surface to port into my disk server at work this as with any device might take a little tinkering and be fairly basic in terms of functionality options but it functions well any web based portals you have to disk servers as well seem to work fine despite the lack of java it also connects with servers and other computers via local networks including homegroups with no problems that i have noticed the other big payoff for this device is the beautiful businesslike design i recommend the magnesium color which might pick up a scuff or two down the road but it really stands apart and shows off the matte metal finish and the unique form factor the kickstand perfectly complements its more laptop than tablet use cases and makes this an attractive and useful fixture on your desk whether that s your workplace office an out of town meeting or the breakfast table
