toshiba has horrible customer service and i would not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not recommend that anyone buy a product made by them ever i purchased this laptop on cyber monday november 2014 and four months after purchase the left hinge failed when opened for normal use i have been battling for two months now with customer service to have this faulty product fixed or replaced to no avail after the first three phone calls where i had to argue that i did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not drop or abuse my laptop i was instructed to take pictures to prove that i did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not abuse or damage the product myself and then pay 30 00 to 34 safely 34 ship my laptop to their service department for repair today i received a phone call from helen mcintosh with pegatron in jeffersonville indiana stating that my lap top would not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not be covered under the standard warranty due to customer damage i was furious and demanded to know how i damaged it and informed her that i have five pictures to prove that there are no scratches dents or cracks on it anywhere after i pressed her for more explanation ms mcintosh informed me that i am not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the first customer with this hinge problem and that the company instructs them to list the item as customer damaged so that it does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not fall under the warranty i argued that it was ridiculous and that it needs to be made right she stated that she was sorry there was nothing more she could do unless i wanted to pay over 500 00 for the repair to a 300 00 laptop and then instructed me to call toshiba back directly with my new information i made three phone calls today because i was disconnected twice and was passed off to countless 34 specialists 34 who all spoke broken english and insisted that my laptop s broken hinge will not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not be covered under the warranty because it was 34 cosmetic damage 34 i demanded to be shown in the warranty which i had in front of me where my faulty hinge was disallowed each time i was shown the section that states cosmetic damage abuse power surges or acts of god etc were all not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not covered under said warranty when i restate that a faulty hinge that will not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not allow the laptop to work at all is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not something that was customer abuse i was repeatedly told that there was nothing that they could do and my only option was to pay for the repair each time i asked to speak with a supervisor each time i was rerouted to someone who repeated the same 34 it s your fault you have to pay 34 result i demanded to speak with someone in america and was only given a mailing address and told to write a letter i looked the number up using the address and was instructed to leave a message and that someone would get back to me within 48 hours by far the worst customer service i ve ever experienced i was sold a defective product and toshiba could care less do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not buy toshiba anything
