the things i like about this laptop are huge 1080p screen great keyboard windows 10 pre installed optical drive graphic card 5500 sound and the 2x3 0 batter life things i don t like the i3 processor but that s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a major issue because it s a 5th gen so that s good overall it is most definitely a great buy and you cannot go wrong with this purchase
