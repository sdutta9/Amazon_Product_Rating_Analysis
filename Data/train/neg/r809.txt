this computer is basically a mac pro windows dell version just a little bit better the aluminium body is strong and beautiful i carry it around with no case and it still it s a 3 month old computer now doesn t have any knacks or scratches i purchased the intel core i5 with 6 gb of ram and this computer works flawlessly no delays no lag it s perfect computer for work if you don t mind the weight about 5lbs my only complain is the wi fi it s quite unstable even with great connection however i strongly believe this is a windows 8 1 issue i installed windows 10 on it and the wi fi issue improved a lot oh also the screen is okay not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not super hd nor super high resolution but it s a nice screen and the touchscreen is very responsive almost compared to an iphone 5
