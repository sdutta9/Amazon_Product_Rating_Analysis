i bought the microsoft surface 2 32 gb in august 2015 before buying this tablet i did some research on it and talked to a friend who owns this tablet from what i found out i decided it would be a tablet worth buying overall i am very satisfied with this product and would give it a four star rating i would definitely recommend it to others especially college students because it is great for note taking and simple computer uses through using this tablet for a couple months i have found many aspects that i like and a few that i am unhappy with features i like 1 the tablet has a wide screen and is light weight it also includes a kickstand that makes it easier for viewing and includes both portrait and landscape views 2 microsoft office bundle excel word outlook powerpoint access and onenote is already installed on the tablet so there was no need to purchase this separately 3 it was fairly priced and was also delivered on time 4 a usb port can be found on the tablet which is one feature not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not included on the ipad this is great to plug a mouse or keyboard into 5 the battery life is long lasting 6 there is a handwriting recognition feature that allows you to use a finger or a stylus it can read both block and cursive writing while i found this table to be mostly what i was looking for i discovered some aspects that i do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not like or that i think could be improved things i do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not like 1 this tablet is windows rt which is fairly limited it restricts you from downloading certain apps like google chrome or spotify 2 keyboard and other accessories are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not included with the tablet 3 the storage is limited but additional storage is available for purchase one suggestion i have would be to purchase a keyboard along with the tablet a keyboard makes the tablet more usable and more like a computer i purchased the microsoft surface type cover 2 which was decently priced and works very well overall this tablet was worth the purchase and i would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a tablet
