after much research and comparisons to many other tablets i think i made a decent choice the windows 8 rt is taking some getting used to it looks nice and the display is good the kickstand is helpful with two positions and you can use it on your lap i did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not buy the keyboard but the on screen keyboard is responsive and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not at all crowded i may eventually invest in a back lit keyboard but for now i don t really need it the weight is fairly light and the size is great for surfaing word processing etc and my sight is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the best the limited amount of apps free or pay is a little bit of a bummer for me but i was aware of that one app i find sorely missing is a good driving navigator there are no free apps for driving navigation and few more than one that actually uses verbal prompts and i want to say that the cost is 2 50 a year the software that is included is fantastic and makes the surface a good value the camera is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the best but i use my phone for pics i got a 64 gb model which in all actuality only gives you 47 gb after the os takes up its portion the battery life seems good as well as it charges quickly the charging cord is rather short the speed of downloads is also pretty good all in all for the price paid on amazon i feel the ms surface 2 is a good choice
