i don t hate this machine at all so why the 1 because i do think that when you spend close to 1k for a piece of equipment it should work they ve had enough time to fix the kinks the wifi card in mine is obviously useless this is an issue discussed widely on the net in the early part of this year but not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not lately so i can only assume these are older machines being sold by this seller it s one think if you re sitting in the us waiting for a tech but if you re on the road with no wifi what then the keyboard is also terrible double strikes constantly edited amazon immediately offered a return slip but as i am not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not in the us now this was an almost impossible solution i searched the net for a long time and uncovered the problem finally if wifi is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not connecting it s because of the windows 10 upgrade an easy adjustment fixed it this seller has the best options in that the bloatware is removed as is vile mcafee you get a clean machine and amazon s shipping is a thousand times better than dell who weren t able to tell me when i might receive a machine
