i was looking for a tablet when i could do college work and read my friend recommended this tablet because its performance and utilities i found it useful but it has some cons that i did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not expected it is described with a 32gb hard drive capacity but it came with 24 6 gb capacity in which 12 6 gb of these 24 6 gb are used for the system configuration it worries me because i had to install over 100 updates that the system requires i installed a 64 gb micro sd card to keep my books and documents to avoid saving my college stuff now as image quality and performance i have no issues office comes free full activated also and already installed i haven t tested the camera nor the microphone so once i do i will edit this review in overall is a good tablet for students and occasional use
