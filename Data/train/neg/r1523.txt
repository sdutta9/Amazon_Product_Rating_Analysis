the laptop refurbished came with excellent conditions but just one little but important detail its hard drive is only 60g not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not 80g as mentioned in the promo i would rate it as 5 but the hard disk only has 40g free given that the vista takes that space i almost would have to buy a new disk make a backup and you know a mess
