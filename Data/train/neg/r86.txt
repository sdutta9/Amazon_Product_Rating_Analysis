i have had this for 6 days and the jury is out i generally like it it s very different from the ipad i have along with a windows 8 laptop and does all the things previous reviewers have noted this is built for work and less for play here are the baffling limitations office only links directly to skydrive there is a dropbox app and you can open files in office and then save to the pc and then upload to dropbox i think my wife s business only uses dropbox so this is a real problem for her and maybe for others forget about any other cloud drives they are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not supported at all and are difficult to use on surface i like sky drive and they give you 7 gb free forever if you are considering this tablet you need to love and use skydiver the spell checker will not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not allow you put sky and drive together in one word the camera app does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not support document scanning or making deposits with banking apps the fixed lens focus is set too far away so documents are too blurry i called tech support and the upshot is that s how it is it takes ok pictures but you have little control over the camera why microsoft couldn t figure out what every other tablet and smart phone camera does is baffling so the camera is an afterthought rather then an attempt to make it something useful and productive if not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not for these two important limitations surface 2 would have been a real home run and an ipad killer the issue is microsoft wanting to control the surface environment completely to the extent that users of other programs will have to take a pass until this stuff is corrected the app store is limited but if you mainly use the web like i do it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a big deal the good office works very well mouse support despite what apple thinks you still need a mouse to be productive the ipad has not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not evolved functionally since it came out good keyboard options the weight of the surface and the ipad with a logitech keyboard feel identical however you can buy a lightweight 11 5 windows 8 laptop asus with the full version of 8 1 for less than surface and the laptop comes with a keyboard of course the trade off is you cannot use it just as a tablet i will update this and decide whether it s a keeper
