i purchased this refurbished about 6 months ago and have been more than pleased with it having been a mac user since the beginning i did a lot of research before i decided to buy a pc let alone a used one i was not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not expecting another mac but i wanted a good daily functional workhorse to have as a backup since my mac is on its last legs it does the basics very well so i have no complaints about that it s also nice to have 4 usb ports instead of 2 and to have a few windows programs that have proven useful my only complaint is that the battery is dead within 6 months replacements are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not too expensive so i can live with that
