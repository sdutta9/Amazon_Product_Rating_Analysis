bought one in the same family piece of garbage hard drive died after 6 months toshiba gives you an option to send it back under warranty but you pay for expensive shipping and they refuse to return your hard drive so you can do data recovery instead they throw it out everyone except one individual in tech support and customer service was downright uneducated and unfriendly never buy bad product which does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not compare to how poor the customer service is
