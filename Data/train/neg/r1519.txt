i was quite surprised when i opened the package and plugged the laptop in i was thinking that maybe tampa laptops made a mistake and sent me a new computer there is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a mark on it anywhere better yet it even has a larger hard drive than what amazon advertised the computer is very fast running xp pro all of the 34 older 34 software i wanted to use loaded and booted without problem so i was good to go in about an hour even factoring in playing around with it a lot it works on battery too although i only had it in use for about 90 minutes and battery operation is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not something i really care about what surprised me is how fast that dell is it seems much faster than my rather new windows 7 lenovo with an i5 processor and 6gb of ram cold boot up to running firefox on the net and using word is well under two minutes when i loaded office on it i was going to make some coffee while waiting when i turned around and glanced at the computer it said it was done already i thought it probably didn t load but it did yes i am very happy with this computer this was an excellent deal for me i expected an old clunker that i could use just as a writer s platform what i received is a fast laptop that will do anything i want and more
