pro you cannot find a 1080p full hd laptop for this price this is why i bought it and this is why it makes it worth every penny good processor speed for the price easily upgradable ram the laptop body looks good has a good feel and an overall quality look to it cons if you are looking to replace the hard drive with a solid state drive its more difficult then most laptops but not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not impossible the dvd tray gets stuck and is more flimsy then most other laptops as always seems to be the trend with new laptops it comes with to much bloatware bloatware unnecessary programs running that are unneeded at take up to much resources mcafee being the worst out if the bunch summary if you are looking for the cheapest 1080p full hd laptop this is the best option in my opinion 1920 1080 resolution is soo much better then the traditional 1366 768 resolution you find in this price range with a 15 6 inch screen this laptop is 141 21 pixels per inch most laptops at this price point and the same screen size are only 100 45 pixel per inch that means there is a 33 higher pixel density
