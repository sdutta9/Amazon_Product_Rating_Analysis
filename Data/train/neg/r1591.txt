this is my first review of anything that i ve purchased off of amazon i m am super pleased with this laptop so i figured others should know as well the only real con to this laptop that upon reboot or just after waking it up it takes time for it to be responsive however with that being said there seemingly have been no issues with this laptop in almost a month of use it will suprisling run several games the only one s i have tried are cod modern warfare and nba 2k15 it definely doesn t run nba 2k15 at high graphics but enough to play the game that s for sure by no means is this a gaming laptop but it will run some games i absolutly love this laptop i am currently a cyber security professional and i got this laptop when it was on sale at 280 and while yes it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the best laptop on the market you cannot go wrong with it at such a reasonable price this is worth every penny
