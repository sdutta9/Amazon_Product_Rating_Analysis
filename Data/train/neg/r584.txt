this asus f55la ab31 is a very good budget low end laptop with windows 10 pre installed all you have to do when you first power it up is to go through a few setup screens choosing the express or the customize settings option i chose the latter because the former uses default settings that have potential privacy impact that i d like to retain control over even with choosing the customize settings scenario which only involved specifying my preferred values for a dozen or so settings i was done with the setup process in less than 30 minutes the laptop weighs about 5 pounds is an inch thick and has dimensions of 10 inches x 15 inches the exterior is mostly black color plastic but the sleek finishing gives it an attractive brushed metal look the cpu for this laptop uses intel s fifth generation i3 dual core processor which uses slightly less power than earlier generation processors the graphics card is the intel hd 5500 which is better than the previous generation intel hd 4400 the laptop comes with 4gb of ram which is sufficient for non demanding tasks such as web browsing and surfing emailing watching dvds and reasonably sized document writing and editing tasks note however that this laptop does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not come with microsoft office and together with the intel hd 5500 powered graphics capability should be good enough for playing non demanding pc games you can add as much as 8gb of additional ram to bring the total to a maximum of 12gb of ram however for file storage the laptop uses a slowish 5400rpm 500gb hard drive which comes already partitioned into a c and a d drive which in the laptop that i received had capacities of 185 and 279 gb respectively you can connect to the internet using either a wired gigabit ethernet lan 10 100 100 or wireless wifi 802 11ac which is faster than the 802 11n but requires a 5ghz band capable access point connection the laptop s 15 6 inch lcd display has no ips for wide angled viewing or touch support but its matte finish and crispy 1920 1080 pixel full hd resolution is better than what can usually be found today in similarly priced low end laptops displays the audio is also very good not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not tinny at all other notable features include a full size but non backlit keyboard with numeric pad touchpad with integrated click buttons a dvd reader writer drive basic 0 3mp vga video conferencing camera two usb 3 0 and one usb 2 0 connector both hdmi and vga external display outputs a combo microphone headphones audio jack multi in one format media card reader and bluetooth 4 0 the battery life is about 4 5 hours but your mileage may vary depending on the demandingness of the tasks being performed and other things such as the brightness level you re using for your display etc in my testing involving almost continuous viewing of amazon prime videos in medium display brightness setting i was able to get a little over 4 hours of usage before i needed to recharge the battery at the end of the 4 hour testing period the fan had not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not been triggered and the palm rest area was not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not even warm there is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not much bloatware but it also doesn t come with even a media player for watching movie dvds for this i decided to download the no cost vlc media player for windows from the videolan website directly you can download the app from the windows store also but i opted not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not to do that overall i think this asus f55la ab31 offers very good value for the relatively low price
