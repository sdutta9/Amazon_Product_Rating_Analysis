1 keep in mind the keyboard us small and the letters will be cramped i have large hands as i wear a size 14 ring if you have large hand and typically don t have to hunt and peck you may be frustrated with the size and might be better with the pro or some other 2 i do like the fact that it uses window 10 and full office 10 that means documents created on a laptop or pc will be interchangeable 3 lots of luck loading windows 10 as it i kept getting error messages and messages that the website was malfunctioning eventually i was able to find where i could communicate with tech service and they called me and eventually loaded it remotely 4 at first i thought the unit did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not come with office 365 and even communicated with amazon cust service who agreed to help me by returning the unit for another giving it one last try i found how to load it in without having to pay for another subscription 5 i will warn you that the font size on settings is small and repetitively i would be typing in a password or the like and for some reason it would jump out of the box if you are typing hunt and peck you are concentrating on looking at the keyboard and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not what is being typed only to find you are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not entering the data you want frustrating 6 the instructions are lacking and you will need to use youtube for your more meaningful instructions my hope is this is just the learning curve and that i will learn workarounds for each and that my original premise for buying it will prove true
