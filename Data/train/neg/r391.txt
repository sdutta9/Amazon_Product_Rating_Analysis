a word of caution i just received this laptop while it does indeed appear to have 4gb and a celeron 2955u processor based on the chrome system information this is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the 34 2015 newest dell chromebook 34 that chromebook has a 180 degree hinge and more rugged chassis this is the 2014 model as best i can tell i am very suspicious of this laptop now that they so blatantly lied about its model year what else is being falsely advertised i am on the fence about going through the trouble of returning it
