for the price it is ok for web browsing and watching movies etc some have said it is slow the initial setup takes quite a long time in comparison to setup of windows 8 from scratch subsequent starts are ok the keyboard takes a little getting used to as the keys are very low i find the touchpad to get in the way and i accidentally hit it when typing compared to my wife s core i3 asus i can find little if any performance difference for the price it s hard to beat
