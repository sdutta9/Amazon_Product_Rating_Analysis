this unit is a convenient size and in three weeks of using it i haven t had a single problem this is a bit of a different experience for me since it doesn t have a hard drive just a 256gb ssd so i have to be a bit more careful of software and data bloat on this computer and just keep it down to what i need to be productive in a portable environment a few notes the screen is attractive and the touch sensitivity works great because of the ssd drive it boots quickly windows 10 installed on this without a hitch and everything runs fine after the upgrade i did get a portable usb optical drive to use with this since to keep things compact they did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not build one in the trackpad works really well i don t use trackpads a lot i carry a spare small wireless mouse instead but this one may be somewhat easier to control than others i ve used this will definitely be my go to unit for business day trips where i need a notebook computer with me it will not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not replace my 17 34 notebook on vacation where i need to do substantial development on the road the screen is just too small to handle hours of dedicated work recommended
