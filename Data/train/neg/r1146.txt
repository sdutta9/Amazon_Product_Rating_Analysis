i purchased this as a gift for my daughter and when it arrived i charged up the battery to make sure it worked when my daughter received it a few weeks later it performed great but when she went to charge it it would not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not charge the charger was putting out the correct voltage but the laptop would not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not accept the charge i took it to a local computer shop to have it checked out and was told the motherboard was defective i tried to return it but the vendor did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not have another in stock i called dell customer support and they said to return it to them and they would refurbish it if i wanted a refurbished item i would have bought one i told them after several calls and 2 hours on the phone they agreed to replace it with a new unit we shall see how long it takes for the replacement to arrive the reason for the one star is that it is apparent that quality control was missing on this unit and having to spent 2 hours pleading my case does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not help build customer loyalty the vendor was kind enough to give me a 40 refund for my trouble
