i was very happy to get this laptop for what i see to be a fair price if not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a good deal other than a pretty consistent occurrence of issues in connecting bluetooth headphones which has lately mostly just been annoying me by crashing netflix if i turn the headset off in the middle of watching i haven t had problems with it i ve had it for a bit over a month and it feels just as fast as the day it arrives hope it keeps up the smooth performance over the months overall very satisfied with this purchase
