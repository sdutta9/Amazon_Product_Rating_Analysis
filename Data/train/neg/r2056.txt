needed to upgrade my netbook and give my old one to my daughter i really like asus i hunted around and finally found this one with a price i could live with everything works great finally figuring out 8 1 windows and liking the touch screen and apps the jack for the sound is the only thing i m worried about it s pretty generic plastic and if i don t have the headphones plugged in before i start a program or change a program in the middle plug or unplug it sometimes it turns the sound off for the whole computer and i have to restart other than that another win for me with asus
