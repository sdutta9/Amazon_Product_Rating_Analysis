my rating of 4 stars i like it is based on judging it for the uses it is intended to handle see below and i didn t give it 5 stars due to the screen being not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the greatest this is an affordable option for those whose needs match it s abilities the screen is decent when viewed from directly in front if you move even three inches to either side the colors skew and it blackens if it tips a half inch forward or back the view is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not right this is important to know if two people are trying to watch a streaming video on the laptop for example something some people do while traveling or when hooking the laptop to a home tv screen via hdmi cable is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not possible the intel core i3 processor helps keep the price low but it limits your use of the laptop this is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not adequate for rendering photos such as digitally altering photos in photoshop or if rendering video when editing video to create video shorts this laptop is best used by one person for basic web surfing streaming video for one person to view for checking email and for using word processor or spreadsheet programs if you have a need for a faster processing speed or want a higher quality screen you will need to go with more expensive models
