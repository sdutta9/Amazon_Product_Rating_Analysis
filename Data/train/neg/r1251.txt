i ve gotten to be a fan of these laptops which i ve bought from several vendors one was fine for months then began reporting itself as 34 not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not genuine windows 34 the others are fine i converted the ungenuine one to ubuntu and it works fine again apart from the os issue they are excellent choices with relatively modern processors upgrade them with a solid state disk drive and you have a very good laptop unlike many newer laptops they have both a serial port and an external vga display output both of which are useful i suggest you inspect them for a certificate of authenticity for whatever os they have installed and run windows update on it right away to make sure it ll be ok the 34 genuine 34 one has now upgraded to windows 10 and it made it fine
