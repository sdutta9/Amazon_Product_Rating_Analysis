i bought this laptop for my business primarily for email and internet searches with occasional media social networking and photo storage this is one of the newest models of dell laptops comes with latest 5th generation processors and graphics engines i find the 5th generation processor upgraded graphics and 4gb memory is more than adequate the screen allows for comfortable viewing without being so large that carrying it around becomes a burden screen is crisp and colors true it has three usb ports and more than enough memory for basic uses and photo storage it has a nice clean look and is a comfortable weight for its size while this might fall short for the avid gamer it fits my needs perfectly with plenty of memory and speed to spare all this at an amazingly low price less than the cost of a high end smart phone makes this a top rated value for anyone looking for an affordable general use notebook dells are usually quality products i highly recommend this model
