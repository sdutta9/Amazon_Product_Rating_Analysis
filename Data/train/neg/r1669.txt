terrible i have a older dell laptop and it was fine i have had this for 3 hours and am not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not happy the ergonomics on this new model are terrible update more issues the wifi has been unreliable and drops out for no reason in addition i cannot write dvds i am able to read them but everyone i try to write one the process hangs about 75 of the way through the track pad is all one piece so the location of the buttons and how it reacts is fraught with issues keep getting accidental selections or the pad thinking i am right left clicking rather than right even when i am intentionally place my hands to left click the mouse just seems to have a mind of its own the case has hard edges so if you rest your hands near the edge your hands feel like they are digging into the sides i am going to give it another day windows 8 1 is a whole other disaster coming from windows 7 but most already know that
