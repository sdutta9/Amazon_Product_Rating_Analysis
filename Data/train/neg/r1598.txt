the price of this laptop matters greatly to its evaluation this isn t a product that s going to turn heads with it s performance i found the laptop to be quite slow to boot up which may prove problematic to people looking for a good computer to use on the go but that overlooks the key aspect of this computer it s a durable and consistent computer that does what you need it to do i ve found that it handles all the current windows software quite well slow yes but it works the only real problem i had with the aesthetics was the keyboard it doesn t really need the extra numbers keys to the right the result is that your hands after far left of center of the keyboard and that does feel a bit awkward this is a four hundred dollar laptop that works well it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not flashy but it gets the job done i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not sure what else you could expect
