let me get this out of the way having owned the surface rt and now the surface 2 i want to start off with the surface 2 is way underrated and definitely better than the generation 1 surface rt yes they are technically the same concept but you have to compare it with the analogy as if they were both cars one is the delorian and one is a mercedes bmw the hardware on the surface 2 is far superior than that of the surface rt but the concept is still the same why did i say that this device has an identity crisis simply this when we use a tablet it s mainly a rectangle where we can carry with us hold on our beds to play minigames read books watch movies tv and use apps the surface 2 can do that but it has problems doing so in my opinion let s start with reading when we read books magazines websites normally we read in portrait mode reading the surface 2 in portrait mode is awkward and hard to hold long without feeling uncomfortable for reading books or magazines etc get a 7 or 8 inch tablet watching tv movies with netflix amazon prime youtube etc don t need an app you can run them natively on the ie browser the apps save netflix are either nonexistent or just plain suck but because you can just use the browser it s like a laptop rather than a tablet and finally the apps what can i say about the apps except that it does have evernote but made poorly the browser login to evernote is better than the app itself you ll find this in a lot of cases either because you are just used to using the browser or you are used to the android or apple version can t install software outside of the app store this statement alone makes the surface 2 a tablet the best way to say is that this is a tablet that tries to be a laptop and a tablet but fails at both because it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not one or the other per se it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the best tablet nor is it a good laptop since you can t install whatever software you want however it does the job of an extension of your pc if you will very well microsoft office is pretty much the same across the board except you can t add any addons such as khalix etc once the microsoft app store is at the same level of android and apple however microsoft has the potential to beat them both however getting there seems to be a huge problem until then though i love using this as an extension of my pc
