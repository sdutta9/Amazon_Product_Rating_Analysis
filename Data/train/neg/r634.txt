pros this very laptop model is thin light somewhat powerful does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not get hot much during use has been working great for the couple of months that i bought it and just looks great especially the external covering and design looks more expensive than is cons three cons for me 1 can t upgrade battery in built and ram apparently 2 no caps lock and num lock led indicators none really asus 3 now this is my biggest gripe about this laptop when you type on the keyboard the way to cheap plastic that surrounds the keys flexes and i really mean flex badly i hate this asus i was beginning to think you all were coming up in the quality product world but this issue makes me re think that don t get me wrong the laptop cost me close to 600 at the time but i would have gladly paid a little more for a more sturdy keyboard and not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not one that flexes so much it is quite noticeable when you type and the surrounding area depresses as well did i say that i hate that what a sore point for what could have been a really great affordable and mid range laptop if anyone from asus is reading this is it possible to obtain from you all a more sturdy stiff covering for the keyboard area i have some experience opening laptops and i was a computer technician in the past is that possible to obtain i would have recommended this brand and model to others but i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not sure if i should this issue leaves a really bad impression as far as i see it but apart from that it does work and does what it should but really already this is unacceptable make s the whole thing feels flimsy and fragile from the typing to get work done perspective that s my two cents
