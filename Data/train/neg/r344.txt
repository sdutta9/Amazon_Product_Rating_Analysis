this tablet works great it s great for viewing youtube videos via wifi and the hdmi connection works with a television too the usb connection acknowledges my usb powered 500 gb buffalo passport drive and videos stream without any problems unfortunately the external drive is only recognized if plugged into the tablet while the tablet is already turned on the tablet doesn t see it if you turn on the tablet while the external drive is already connected still trying to figure that out one disappointment is that the tablet doesn t seem to have wifi direct i was hoping to use this tablet as a remote control for a panasonic dslr dmc g6 camera still on a learning curve with it videos stream well from a micro sd 32 gb card haven t tried anything larger battery seems to be lasting a long time and the wifi seems to work well i ve been about 30 feet from the 2 wire att modem streaming videos the modem is set to low power
