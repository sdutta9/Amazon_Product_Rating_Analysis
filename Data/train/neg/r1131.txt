for the most part this computer worked fine and i liked it the problem i had was that the internet connection kept disconnecting it would eventually reconnect but sometimes took 2 3 minutes it became very annoying and i only had the computer for a few days i know it was this computer because all the other laptops in the house didn t have this problem i returned it
