i was very impressed by its features but when i bought one and tried use it was nothing but frustration the display stops functioning and the screen goes blank quite often it recovers after a few seconds very annoying the surface book suddenly goes blank and shuts off you have to struggle very hard to turn it on many times the long hold of the power key did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not work in short the surface book in its present form is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not much more than a non functional toy it is a serious problem microsoft released such a beta unit to the public the fact they released extensive software and firmware updates immediately after release clearly suggests microsoft knew of these issues before it is released the over 1gb updates did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not solve the above problems after struggling for several weeks returned the unit to amazon of course amazon s customer service was great but reliability of the surface book was awful i hope microsoft stops selling the current version and releases a more reliable version
