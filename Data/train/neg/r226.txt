i bought a surface 2 64gb for my husband a month ago when they first came out it worked great until yesterday when a recent update changed the volume level so you can barely hear it when streaming a movie or listening to online music the volume level is at 100 and is fine if you want the tablet next to your head or exclusively use headphones according to microsoft technical support this is a known issue and there is no resolution for this at this time they were not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not able to give me a time frame for this to be resolved save your money until this issue is taken care of i spoke to them today it is a nice product but this issue reduces the tablet s value in my opinion i hope microsoft listens to its customers and fixes this issue very soon
