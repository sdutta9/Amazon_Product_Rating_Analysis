i m giving this two stars because it s a decent e reader and netflix hulu playing device beyond that though there isn t much here the os window rt is incredibly limiting you can only use the apps available in the windows store that were designed specifically for this os that means no legacy software you are locked into internet explorer because the product sold so poorly that developers didn t bother porting over other browsers the kicker is you can t even install add ons for ie you can certainly visit the add ons section and download them but they won t actually install another problem is that if you go back a webpage the previous page hasn t been cached you end up staring at an image of the page while waiting for it to reload i also have an issue with the device thinking i want to scroll left and right when i want to scroll up or down i guess you need to be very precise with your direction not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not diagonal in any way overall it s a frustrating experience that i can t recommend to anyone i should have stuck with android or purchased an actual windows 8 device instead
