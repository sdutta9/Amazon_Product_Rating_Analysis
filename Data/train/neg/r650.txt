i spent about 20 hours researching laptops because it is so difficult to find the best one at the best price this is a good basic laptop for somebody who needs it for using microsoft office netflix skype streaming and internet browsing this laptop will do all of those seemingly easily do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not buy it expecting it to do video rendering and 3d rendering but the new i3 processor will handle basic stuff easily for the price it is great pros the new 5th gen i3 processor is the latest technology which is nice laptop is quiet not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not really any fan noise disk drive is nice to have lots of usb ports two 3 0 s price is excellent full keyboard the original 4gb of ram can be expanded easily to i think 8 or 12 gb looks nice good battery watched 2 3 episodes of netflix at full brightness and was only down to 78 1 year free acer accident warranty is awesome cons i was a little disappointed in the screen one big reason we bought it was that it was a real 1080p screen however the screen did not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not seem to be any better than my 720p acer laptop also colors are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not very vivid but hey its less than 400 screen at full brightness is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not particularly bright only 4 gb ram and 500 gb hard drive but can be expanded materials seem a bit cheap it is definitely not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not premium feeling was slower than i expected but it is only a dual core i3 still i expected the newest technology to be faster no touchscreen option not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not lit keys overall this is the best budget laptop for the price in my opinion it got good reviews i am happy overall the i3 version doesn t have the absolute best specs or material but it will do the basic things you need reliably will probably upgrade in the future but for the daily school use and projects it works great
