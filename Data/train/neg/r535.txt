this is a wonderfull product with a very high resolution screen operates well as a tablet or a laptop with the keyboard accessory essential windows 10 needs more time for me to get comfortable 4 days so far but i think i ll be fine this choice is an upgrade from a samsung android 7 tablet used for the past two years and i wanted a hybrid tablet pc the larger memory is probably well worth the added expense since windows software takes up so much space and over time other apps and storage will be needed i think it is expandable with a micro sd card i have also already used the usb slot with an 8 g thumb drive with no issue with the step up hard drive comes 4 gigs of ram which is also a big plus for speed with multiple apps open the stylus accessory is a little touchy but perhaps needs more practice on my part so far this product is a winner
