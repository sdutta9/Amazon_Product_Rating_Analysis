the laptop looks nice runs well with quad core and a normal 1366x768 screen wish it can be higher and battery lasts as said so however its mouse point will frequently freeze for awhile and then come back even after all updates i consider the biggest drawback of this computer is only having one memory slot which accepts 8gb ram not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not sure if it works for single 16gb ram another smaller issue is that the touch pad is a bit far away from the edge than other brands such as macbook or hp so one might frequently press wrong spots other than touch pad buttons
