this notebook is everything that i wanted dell did a fantastic job designing this notebook well worth the buy for what you actually get i can t find a thing that really turned me off from the device the machine itself is aesthetically beautiful puts you in the mind of a macbook which i dont mind at all it does have a numpad which i do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not mind but i almost never us it and do find myself hitting the numlock button often as it is right beside the backspace button the system is crisp and speedy the startup is fast and quick which is always a plus i do highly recommend that you get an ssd do yourself a favor and just get one hard drives are great but and ssd will make it more notebook like in my opinion installing an ssd is simple and incredibly easy on this notebook which i absolutely love make sure you clone the notebook first samsung s migration software is a keeper but only works on samsung ssd s just power off the notebook and unscrew the bottom panel and be careful not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not break any of the clamps once your inside unscrew the hd then just unplug the 2 5 hd and plug in your ssd after that screw your notebook back together and bam you are ready to rock and roll 4 usb 3 0 1 sd slot 1 hdmi 1 ethernet 1 3 5 jack you can use an external mouse to wake your notebook you have to change the setting inside the bios 1080p display touch display if you are into that not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not very intuitive and i despise fingerprints fans are at the bottom so be careful not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not to clog the vents speakers at the front crisp and clear sound there is no lip to easily open the notebook but it will open without flopping up lastly back light keyboard always a plus for those that travel i paid 630 for this notebook used amazon warehouse deal no scratches only notebook and charger came if you are need of a new notebook then i recommend you give this a try no regrets
