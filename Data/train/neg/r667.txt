i needed a new laptop that had a decent amount of speed capable of keeping up with my work requirements first the good this is indeed a speedy computer it ll get the job done and was definitely quite enough to keep up with my workflow requires for reference i work in seo and so often have many many tabs open on google adwords analytics and other similar website overall it ll get the job done now for the bad at first i was a little frustrated when this came in because this laptop required a number of atk updates and driver updates to function properly example the fn f9 keys wouldn t actually turn off the touchpad speaking of the touchpad it has a weird design where the touchpad area overlaps the right and left click function so if you use one hand to move the mouse and another to left click you ll be moving your mouse unintentionally to other locations when attempting to left click trying to scroll by holding the left click is also a pain in this regard as you will frequently move the mouse unintentionally off the scroll bar because the touchpad will detect both fingers on the touchpad overall if you are like me and use one finger on touchpad and another on left click you ll get annoyed quickly this can be solved by simply using a mouse so it s just a bit of a peeve for me but here is what kills me and had i had known about this i would not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not have made this purchase the wireless card is extremely weak on this laptop for reference i m currently less than 6 feet away from my router and the best signal i can receive is 2 5 bars to reference my old hp laptop and all of my other wireless devices can get 5 5 or 4 5 bar signal from completely across the house from multiple rooms away and with many obstructions i own an asu rt ac53u for reference where my other wireless devices can detect signals coming from my neighbors this laptop can only see my home wireless router and needs to be within 6 8 feet to even function my workplace is currently a hot desk environment so this major problem prevents me from using this computer to work at home i have to use an ethernet wire to get any decent internet speed out of this machine a very disappointed customer
