i purchased the microsoft surface 2 with the intent of taking away the need to carry a laptop away from home there was not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a lot of research done before making the purchase but it has been one of the best purchases i have made to date the surface was overall a great investment it s lightweight compact in size and relatively durable those three things alone make it perfect to carry around all day in your backpack or purse while being compact it is large enough that it s not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not difficult to read text on the screen if you feel you need added external protection you can purchase a padded protective case i have not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not purchased a case and my tablet has not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not had any issues the surface has nearly all of the same inputs outputs as your typical laptop those being an sd card slot a usb slot and an hdmi output it also has internal speakers and both rear and front facing cameras the internet capabilities are comparable to a laptop and i have personally had no issue with the internet on top of those features the surface came with the full windows office package which includes word excel outlook powerpoint and onenote while this tablet doesn t come with an external keyboard the on screen keyboard does just fine for small projects if you do plan to type on this tablet a lot an external keyboard can be purchased as well the onedrive feature can also be used on this tablet which connects you to all of your other files saved to the drive from any windows source this is very helpful when using multiple windows products and needing to have access to files on all of them this tablet is perfect for someone looking to downsize from lugging around a laptop all the time it would be very handy for a student or a person in business type of work in these types of situations this tablet would be perfect for giving presentations and taking notes the basic features of a laptop are there but without the weight and size of a standard laptop
