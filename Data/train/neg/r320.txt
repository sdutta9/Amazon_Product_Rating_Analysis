i bought this tablet at the end of may 2014 for 144 00 it s white which was cheaper than the black from the description they sounded the same i see this tablet at 8 gb at a now higher price so i bought this at the right time i am in my late 60 s woman not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not really tech savvy but do have a dell laptop i had to have help getting on wi fi but that was easily resolved by going back to the settings and undoing what i did and starting the set up again i got this for traveling since it is very light and portable note i got the fintie folio case to protect this tablet primarily i email surf the web and watch youtube videos the keyboard on the screen was not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not too hard to get used to it s good for the brain to try different ways of doing things i have yet to remove any apps or download any new ones for what i got this for it s an excellent tablet so far
