i was really pleased to get a new inexpensive laptop that fit my needs i really wanted a 1080p screen and a number pad on the keyboard and i got what i wanted easily added 8gb of memory to this for a few bucks and using it as a family mobile workstation pros 1080p screen at this price point is unheard of windows 10 out of the box no fiddling with 8 1 upgrade to 10 love the number pad on the keyboard very inexpensive easy to upgrade memory to something more respectable stays super cool to the touch even when playing games cons the screen is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the most beautiful but that was expected there is some slight light leakage and viewing the screen from an angle reduces the picture noticeably color looks a tad washed out works fine for homework office work and internet browsing maybe not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not so great for watching videos 2 cell non user serviceable battery means even though this is a low power device run time is still not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not very high 3 hours of light medium use not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a fan of the 1 piece touchpad but it s usable maybe a tad oversensitive lack of documentation from manufacturer is annoying it s like this model doesn t exist box comes with zero product documentation there might be some on the laptop itself but i didn t see it right away not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a touch screen i knew this and i had no need for a touch screen but this might be a deal breaker for some rj 45 network jack utilizes some kind of collapse able clip i m concerned that this will get broken off at some point and make connecting to a physical network impossible with a usb network adapter luckily this will be using wifi almost 100 of the time overall i felt like this was a steal i have been looking for months for a laptop with some of these features and was never able to get anywhere near this set of features or this price point so happy i m seriously considering buying another for this family of 6
