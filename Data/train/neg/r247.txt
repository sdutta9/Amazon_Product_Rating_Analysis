overall a solid unit especially as a refurb but the speakers on this thing are weak for anyone paying full price if you care about the fact that your audio will distort during scenes of high volume do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not buy this unit while the rest of the unit is pretty solid and enjoyable the speakers on this things are pretty awful it loses two stars just for the speakers
