i bought this computer at this point to search for a job it has worked well however i do get a webpage that pops up once in while that locks me out of the internet so i have to shut it down which is a huge pain but i don t believe this has anything to do with the laptop it pops up through google chrome i almost bought a toshiba but saw this dell and for about 20 more included several more nice features like a back lit keyboard
