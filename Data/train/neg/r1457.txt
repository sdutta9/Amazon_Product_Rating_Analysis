i bought my laptop four months ago and it has held up nicely i use it constantly because i run an online business and it s a great little workhorse the only complaint i have is that the sound is very faint i have to turn the volume all the way up to hear it decently from the speakers it s most likely a flaw in the particular computer i got since it s used but other than that i have no complaints this machine has served me well
