i got what i expected for a refurbished dell 630 it was slow as sin and took about four hours of cleaning installing speed up software and removing unwanted programs what i am not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not pleased about is every time i log on i get a notice that the version of windows installed is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not genuine what s up with that it is working but if this is pirated software that is pretty lame on the vendors part
