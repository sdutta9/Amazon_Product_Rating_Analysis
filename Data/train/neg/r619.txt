initial impression is that this laptop is a lot more plastic y than i would ve imagined i had recommended this laptop to a friend because the price and the fact that it is the most reasonably priced 1080p laptop the next available 1080p laptop is somewhere in the 600 700 range and he was in no position to purchase that one your results may vary but initially the trackpad had an issue where the left click clipping the bottom left corner because the clicking surface was misaligned tracing the bottom left outline of the trackpad help correct this issue it is on the cheaper side so i cant expect the same level of quality control some of the higher priced asus laptops would have i am somewhat complaining about the plastic construction but you get what you pay for the real meat of this laptop is the technology housed in that plastic it doesnt have the best viewing angles but i am quite pleased with the 1080p screen and i hope this trend will carry over into all modern laptops the i3 feels snappy and 4gb of ram is enough for the average user consumer my only real complain is that this laptop was not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not made with serviceability in mind installing additional ram is easy enough once you get past the plastic security piece over the ram cover the task of installing an ssd or sshd is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not for the faint of heart because some disassembly is required i would knock 1 star off typically but after disassembling with the intent of installing an ssd the internal hardware layout does make sense criticism aside for the price this is a pretty nifty little laptop with a solid state it will fly and the user experience is great i would hope for a similar spec d design laptop but made of aluminum for 100 200 more but you definitely get value 62 350 with this laptop video disassembly to install ssd sshd
