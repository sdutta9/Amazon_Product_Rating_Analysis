i just purchased this laptop and it s been out of the box for less than 24 hours i m really liking it so far and will update if there are any major issues in the next few weeks or months i m writing this review to list a few likes and dislikes that i think will be helpful for people to know who are considering buying this laptop likes so far it was really easy to update to windows 10 right after the laptop arrived i was prompted towards the beginning of the start up to upgrade but i chose to wait until after making a 8 1 recovery usb after that i searched for an update and was again given the option to upgrade to windows 10 the whole process took less than an hour the rounded edge below the keyboard and touch pad if you rest your hands on your laptop a lot it is easy to notice the difference between this and other edges that feel sharp and like they re digging into your skin the touch screen responds to my touch fast and is a great option to have especially when i don t have a mouse around dislikes so far this is on me for not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not researching this laptop better before purchasing it but after using it for a few hours i noticed a black border around my desktop that worried me i thought something was wrong with my new laptop i frantically searched online for answers and discovered the black border is normal and just part of the design of the pc if you re picky about the way your display looks you might want to pass on this laptop if that black border sounds like something that would get on your nerves right after i discovered it was not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the display acting up i stopped noticing it while using the computer it s very easy to get used to but it was a surprise i could have done without and i might not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not have purchased the laptop if i knew about it beforehand the speakers are not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not great adequate but pretty 34 blah 34
