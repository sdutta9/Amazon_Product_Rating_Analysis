i bought two of these the first one was in excellent condition really impressive for a refurb so when hubby murdered his laptop by spilling a drink into it i thought this d630 would be the perfect replacement for him when it arrived we were both a bit disappointed it functions correctly but has a loose lid screen that can wobble and some sticking keys and generally looks quite used he s satisfied enough to keep it partly because he doesn t want to be without one for any length of time and partly because we ve had positive experiences with off lease dells in the past even if they have a wart or two my personal disappointment was that after receiving the first one i expected the same level of quality from the second one because at that time it was sold by amazon not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a marketplace refurb seller where you can never be sure of what you ll get until you open the box
