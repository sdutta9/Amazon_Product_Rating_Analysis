i bought this for my daughter for middle school as i have been very happy with my dell laptops so far however this one is of really bad quality the first one we received had a non functioning keyboard after countless hours with dell computer support in india they could not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not fix this over the phone and sent another computer the second one has a non functioning mouse pad after countless hours with dell technical support in india they told me this second computer is also defective i am running out of patience and trying to get a refund but so far without success dell is sending me from customer support to technical support then i get disconnected and i have to go through the same process again i am very frustrated
