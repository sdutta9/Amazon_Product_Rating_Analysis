this laptop provides a good bang for the buck although it feels like the specs are hampered a bit by some of the dell software it ships with as the system can be a bit slow to boot the touch screen is clear and nice to use and the touch pad works well my biggest complaint is with the keyboard which is cheap and flimsy once every few days the n key will come off and i have to mess with it to reattach it surprising dell would slap such a cheap keyboard on a laptop with these specs
