warning do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not buy this piece of crap i bought this tablet to use for school after first having tried it at my local best buy store and what reeled me in was the ability to take notes on it that were actually legible i really liked the idea of being able to make my school bag smaller and the fact that this is more of a pc than it is tablet sounds great right wrong microsoft recently switched all of their surface products to windows 10 the surface i tried at my local best buy was running windows 8 the difference between the two is night and day as it currently stands the surface 3 is a frustrating experience when taking notes the surface thinks my palm pressure should bring up the keyboard and an option to cut and paste my work this doesn t seem like a big deal until you realize this is happening a few hundred times during a 1 hour lecture wanna send notes to friend that missed class not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not happening the format isn t supported by other computers wanna play games from the app store nope not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not unless you re into microsoft only apps will your internet connection be reliable with this device absolutely not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not the kindle fire has better internet reliability than this device until microsoft fixes the bugs with windows 10 the surface 3 will stand to be runner up to whatever icrap comes out at the end of the year do yourself a favor and buy a decent laptop it only took me two weeks to realize why i hated everything about microsoft with the surface 3 now i have to go spend the rest of my day transferring my notes from onenote and drop box so that i can actually use the information i need thanks microsoft
