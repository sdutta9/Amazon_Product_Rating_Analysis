screen cracked 5 weeks after purchase now it is forever clicking on the left side of the screen dell wants 269 to fix it and all i did was close the lid and put it down if the screen can crack by touching the keyboard the product is really poorly designed doesn t actually serve as a laptop since the bottom gets too hot to put on your lap dell software is buggy and the convertible functionality refuses to work if you open the screen to tent mode half the time it will not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not rotate the battery life is good the screen is bright and pretty windows 10 is terrible there is virtually nothing about the software that is good for touchscreens in tent or tablet mode items in native programs like file explorer are still too close together to be manageable and i have skinny piano fingers touchscreen gestures are impossible to alter and the screen itself picks up gestures i m not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not making half the time i click it detects two fingers and does a right click the lack of pressure sensitivity means art and design applications are pretty useless it looks like a surface but doesn t act like one no matter what you do using the stylus feels like using a marker the keyboard layout is annoying dell left in useless keys like insert print screen and caps lock while pushing indispensable web browsing keys page up down and home end into function combinations the keyboard backlight turns itself on every time you reboot the computer i don t know who this is an attractive feature for i haven t looked down at the keyboard since i was 9 years old
