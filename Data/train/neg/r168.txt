i had decided to purchase this at the last minute for a christmas gift it was exactly as described and shipped in 2 days so it did arrive before christmas i purchased this for my husband he lives and dies by outlook so i needed a tablet that would do that he is having to learn windows 8 so that is a bit of a challenge he loves the size and weight of the tablet still exploring what it can do love that it has the usb port unlike the ipad as most people know the ipad has more apps but since he is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a 34 gamer 34 or into apps it is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not a problem
