i bought this 34 refurbished 34 which is to say with windows xp already up and running not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not quite sure that s a true refurb but who cares i never completely trust inherited computers so i booted the included re installation disc reformatted the drive and hours and hours later of installing the drivers specific to this hardware i had me one sweet ride note never buy an xp with less than 2gb of mem and always demand an installation disc i used driverupdate to download most of the drivers but still needed to manually track down drivers for the vga card and the touchpad stick
