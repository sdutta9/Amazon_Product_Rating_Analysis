very disappointed whether it is the fault of dell windows 10 or dell s adaptation to windows is beyond me in one of two regular locations the computer could not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not connect to the wireless router until i rebooted the router no other devises in the home had this problem it has rebooted spontaneously shut done incorrectly and frozen up requiring popping the battery in order to unfreeze it it has trouble recognizing the external monitor which i rely on for color consistency when editing photos it does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not recognize external hard drives plugged into a usb3 7 port but recognizes them immediately when they are plugged into a usb2 which is plugged into the usb3 in my other location it recognizes the external hard drives plugged intousb3 what strange thing is it going to do next i have had it for about a month and have come to distrust it i expected much better and got something much worse
