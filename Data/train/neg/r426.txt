i received the sp4 one day after it was released and i have been working with it now for three weeks i have been using a macbook pro 15 inch for the last 7 years and ipad since 2011 here are my impressions i think the best use for the sp4 is a mobile desktop the sp4 shines when connected to an external monitor and wireless keyboard mouse i say mobile desktop because it is 1 7 lbs so moving it between my home office and work office is extremely easy just plug it and you have a full powerful desktop i give it here 5 5 stars i would give my older macbook pro 4 5 because is is heavier 4 7 lbs to carry around i think the second best use is tablet while its sw is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not optimized for touch and it is not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not light like ipad air 1lb i still think the combination of the large screen 12 dedicated for single app kickstand and stylus is great so i give it in that regard 4 5 and i give my ipad 3 5 5 i think the worst use for sp4 is laptop mode in laptop mode the screen becomes small for multiple apps furthermore the highly reflective screen makes it hard to work for a long time on it i give it here a score of 3 5 while i give my macbook pro 5 5 overall i give it 3 5 because of the poor battery life that does not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not last beyond 4 5 hours of real use is it for you it depends on how to use it if you are a road warrior always working in hotels airplanes and cafes then i do not not_not not not_not not not_not not not_not think you should get it if you plan to spend 70 80 of the time pairing it with a large screen and wireless keyboard then definitely get it if you really need a stylus teachers and students in tablet mode then get it if there is no urgent need then you should wait because the sw has lots of bugs and ms is still rolling out critical updates in terms of hw i feel the worst aspects are 1 poor battery life 2 high reflectively screen 3 power button next to volume button and 4 one usb slot
