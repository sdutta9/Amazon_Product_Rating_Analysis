first i did not not_not not not_buy my hp laptop from amazon i got it at a retailer having said that it s still an hp so this review is still valid the problem with most reviews is they are given within a very short time after receiving the product well i ve had my hp for over 2 years now and it has been 6 good months followed by 18 of the worst technology related months of my life at about 6 months the screen started flickering not not_not not not_every once in awhile but so much that the screen seems to go dark from it and i m sure if i was prone to seizures i would be sitting in a mansion paid for by hp i found the problem when one of the hinge covers finally popped off on its own there is a cable by the left hinge that must be getting pinched because i can stick a mechanical pencil in there and jiggle the wire and it stops for a bit also since about 6 months after purchase the computer started lagging and freezing sometimes the mouse freezes or the cursor completely disappears from the screen sometimes it comes back on its own and sometimes i have to do a hard shut down and turn it back on also since about 6 months in the trackpad s two finger gestures don t work about 25 of the time more recently i have been getting the 34 plugged in not not_not not not_charging 34 message hp seems to be competing with comcast for worst customer service as well basically i wouldn t recommend an hp brand flashlight let alone a laptop or tablet from them it s a shame because they used to be great now they are just living off their name recognition and selling the same chinese manufactured crap as everyone else i wish i could afford a new laptop but i m stuck with this garbage for now my next purchase when i m able to afford it will be an asus or i ll see how the new microsoft surface book does
