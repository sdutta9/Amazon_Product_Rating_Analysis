i purchased a similar version of this computer inspiron 5547 in december of 2014 and have regretted it from day one the keyboard and touch pad are very poorly made the touch pad failed within four months of purchase and despite hours on the phone with dell customer support and sending it in to be repaired it has never worked correctly since the problem began i have noticed that if i have even the slightest amount of moisture on my hands like on a warm august day then the touch pad stops working or goes haywire today the computer locked up and is stuck in an alternating pattern between the windows app screen and the desk top i am very close to writing this computer off as a complete loss and buying a new one from a different manufacturer save your money your time and your frustration buy a laptop from someone other than dell
