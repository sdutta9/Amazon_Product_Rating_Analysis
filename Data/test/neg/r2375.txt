so far this laptop seems a decent value for the money and for my usage i wanted a laptop with a large screen to replace a standard computer with a sizable monitor connectivity is not not_not not not_lightening fast but adequate wasn t wild about the large touch pad so i m using a mouse wired which works fine the keys are sizable and easy to type on and as a writer this is important to me i d recommend this for basic computer needs especially word processing but not not_not not not_for travel or where fast speed is needed i m hoping this dell product gives years of good service we shall see
