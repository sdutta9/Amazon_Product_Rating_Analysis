alright i ve had this laptop for over a year now and i use it for school work and play i waited at least a year to review so that i could provide a more complete one great things about it durability the laptop is still in great condition physically despite having been dropped quite many times and hauled around in a book bag every day don t get me wrong i ve done the most i can to take care of it regular cleaning updates regular use protective casing inside booksack etc touch screen over a year and it still works like new still very happy with the flip feature as well speed for a small laptop i thought the clock speed the features gave was pretty decent but it hardly ever actually reaches that for it to be an average i m fairly certain this goes for all computers though so admittedly i was naiive however the laptop still runs just as fast as the day i got it even with photos video games assassin s creed ii borderlands 2 assassin s creed revelations all of which are pushing this graphics card to its limit but it s marching on and 2 years worth of school work things that aren t so great audio i was not not_not not not_picky about what the audio was like but i should have been mine has beats audio which there is a patch to disable on hp support forums no matter the sound program though it is inconsistent between different types of head or earphones but when nothing is in the audio jack everything is fine and dandy until the volume gets above 60 also the speakers on the laptop are in a place that gets muffled which is why i am having to turn the volume so loud above 60 the speakers seem to 34 buzz 34 a bit and i am not not_not not not_sure why when the audio jack decides to work properly this is not not_not not not_an issue the touchpad it is often unresponsive when i do actually need it i had the computer for a little under a year before it showed any problems in this area i have a mouse too so normally it s not not_not not not_a big deal to switch up more often than not not_not not not_the synaptics touchpad is disabled altogether to save myself the frustration
