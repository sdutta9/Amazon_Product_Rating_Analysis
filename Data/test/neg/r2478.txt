stay away from this laptop i bought the amd a8 8gb 13 model back 8 14 and after 3 months use i hate it 1st the i ve to reinstall the touch pad drivers twice because they seem to randomly stop working 2nd the wifi on thing is a joke you get 2 5ghz not not_not not not_5ghz and it the connection will drop at random turns out this is a known issue and hp has been dragging their butts to fix it just do a web search for hp pavilion x360 wifi problem and you ll see that this has been going on from months i should have paid extra for the yoga 2 with the 8gb in it
