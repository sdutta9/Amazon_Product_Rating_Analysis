edit i purchased an 8gb stick of ram and now this computer works pretty well i can watch netflix now i haven t needed to reboot in two days i revise my previous opinion of this machine all it needs is a ram upgrade and it s just fine for the price i suspect that an additional processor upgrade would make it great for the price hands down this is the worst computer i ve ever owned it s barely fast enough to run netflix videos and if i don t restart it every couple hours it will be too slow to use on top of this the windows 8 operating system is extremely poorly designed i recommend taking your 269 and going to a pawn shop i can t imagine you d do much worse than this machine
