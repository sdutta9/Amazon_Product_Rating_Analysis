laptop is low average quality and over priced for the product computer was sluggish to begin with even with upgrade of faster processor and additional ram made at time of initial purchase after the first year of use the computer completely died working with dell technical support has been a long protracted and woefully disappointing battle after over a month the laptop is still dead in the water bear in mind this is after sending the laptop back to the dell center for repairs computer was sent back still broken and after site visits from dell tech subcontractors who have made scheduling repairs next to impossible and have yet to bring any life back to the computer computer is under full warranty yet dell has refused to replace the computer if further efforts to repair it fail my last computer was also a dell and was fraught with technical problems as well so this will be my last dell i would strongly recommend going with another brand all together microsoft lenovo chromebook or mac will not not_not not not_be working with dell again
