initially very slow as most windows 8 pc s are as they install the hundreds of updates while you remove all the bloatware crap pre installed i purchased this for my company which relies heavily on basic web use and typically it gets a good 6 hours of on off use the touch screen is not not_not not not_very responsive compared to other windows 8 convertibles i used but i don t find this entirely necessary once all the nonsense is removed it runs pretty snappy
