this is a general post about hp customer support i ve had an hp for 4 years which i have taken really good care of both in equipment upgrades and protection from viruses and malware it still works fine and more powerful than some new models i had an issue with a windows upgrade that corrupted my boot sector requiring an original installation disc to repair since my pc came preloaded i contacted hp to obtain an original installation disc they declined to assist me saying my pc was 4 years old and obsolete i m sorry it is up to me to determine whether it still has a useful life i reminded them that they are still selling pcs that are less equipped than mine with windows 7 as the os and that i just wanted the disc they owed me nevertheless they refused this is not not_not not not_customer service in any fashion i now in good conscience could never recommend hp as as a company to do business with good companies take care of their customers when they can not not_not not not_make excuses why they will not not_not not not_they have lost my business forever buyers beware
