pros this laptop has a nice display very quiet while running nice quiet keypad and all the other good comments that others have already said cons my experience touchy mouse pad left click right click portion and most importantly this laptop is constantly losing its wifi internet connection although it takes 5 seconds to correct this it is still very annoying why would dell sell something that has a obvious issue this is 2014 and there is no reason for this i ve attempted updating the drivers from the dell website with no luck it s frustrating
