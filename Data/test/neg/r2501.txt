i will never buy an hp product again the laptop will not not_not not not_power on and hp online support has at least eight users with the same problem and no solutions posted my problem i need to do a hard reset and you can t remove the battery on this laptop so there s a combination of button pushes but since hp has approximately 400 models with 400 unique combinations trust me i ve watched their video their models sound like condo development names hey how much money did they save by omitting a reset button or was it because they figured that since they re in silicon valley they re cool like apple nuh uh oh i tried calling online support but couldn t find a human after all i just need to know the magical key combination
