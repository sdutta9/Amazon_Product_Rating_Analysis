at first i was excited about this purchase it was affordable touch screen light weight and had decent specs i never had an issue with my previous hp which i used for five years and i still use it because my new hp won t work i have been using this new hp for six months and as much as i appreciate the touch screen i hope i can return it because of these issues n the computer will connect to wifi but will not not_not not not_have internet access i have taken it to the shop twice and they are unsure about the cause n the battery life was great at first but during the fifth month it tanked to 2 hours n several times the touch feature has become unresponsive n occasionally it will completely power down upon closing the lid not not_not not not_due to low battery n twice the mouse pad has become unresponsive and the cursor has disappeared i had to restart to regain function n on once occasion the screen brightness stayed on the dimmest setting for an entire week despite restarting multiple times it returned to normal brightness suddenly at a time that i was not not_not not not_pressing any keys n overall programs are slow to open and files are slow to load ni am disappointed in this purchase and i am beginning to think that investing in a mac is worth the money
