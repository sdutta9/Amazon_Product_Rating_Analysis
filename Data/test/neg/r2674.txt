this is the worst laptop i have ever used it runs incredibly slow even though i purchased this two weeks ago and i only run a few programs at a time for example it freezes when i use firefox and outlook and that s it the cursor disappears the touchpad is not not_not not not_responsive at all so you have to click something three times for it to go through finally the volume turns itself up and down by itself sometimes the laptop tells me that the battery life will last 346 hours the wifi capability is horrible and it will not not_not not not_connect to your wifi unless you are sitting right next to the modem router ni would return this in a heartbeat if i could
