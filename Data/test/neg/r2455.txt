overall i would give it a satisfactory rating it does tend to drop the internet frequently that was easily corrected by changing the settings the touch pad does not not_not not not_have the split selector so you have to often have to look to make sure you are clicking on the side you want the touch pad also makes a little too much noise for my taste the low profile keys take a little getting used to but it s not not_not not not_too bad the appearance of the screen is great but the sound quality leaves a little to be desired it is okay for movie watching for an individual person but if you are trying to show a dvd to a group you can t get the sound loud enough i wish it did not not_not not not_have windows 8 1 the operating system is difficult to use and everything is moved no longer can you click the start menu and find all your programs the area where the start menu used to be takes you to the 8 1 desktop with all the apps the best way to find something in this os is to use the search option takes a little longer but it s less frustrating not not_not not not_a bad computer just not not_not not not_the best dell i have ever had
