like it a lot best of all it has windows 7 can t stand window 8 and thereafter it s a big computer it stays home for the price it is top notch please bear this review in mind with the price the screen cover is thin and i m always conscientious of this so no heavy things on top and because it s thin it wobbles when you adjust the angle and when you move the laptop the sound is not not_not back and loud enough for my purposes the dvd player is a bit flimsy but it has not not_not failed and does the job after ms vista you cannot buy to own ms office apps you rent or buy the annual license to used ms word office you ll be paying every year this is crap one reason i am keeping my older laptops just so i don t have to keep buying the right to use office word or excell or access anyone who uses the cloud storage for important document is crazy it s not not_not your document if it s in some one else s home is it keep you own external storage drivers i would only keep downloaded music in any floating storage facility i wouldn t even keep pictures in any fluff storage the picture is sharp color is true but the screen is much wider than i m used to because of the thinner bezel you have more viewing screen nothing is wrong with this i just have to get used to it not not_not that crazy about the clear glossy screen it does reflects too much back image but it does give the picture clear and truer color display really great watching movies in the dark i ll be using this for the internet and saving my older laptop for work for a couple of hundred bucks this laptop is a great value would have given it 5 stars if it the keyboard was backlit
