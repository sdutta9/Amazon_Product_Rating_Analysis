i love that this surface came with a one year warranty because after i began to play with my surface for a few hours the screen began to freeze and became pixilated when i asked the employee at microsoft what was wrong they couldn t give me an answer just that it was refurbished however they honored my one year warranty and gave me a brand new surface 2 which works perfectly and i love it it will be very covenant for school purposes instead of lugging around my macbook
