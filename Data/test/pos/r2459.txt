purchased this laptop to stream video s youtube netflix amazon prime sports movies etc to my 60 tv via hdmi hookup was a little concerned at what minimum spec s it takes to do something like that reliably did a lot of searching and ended up with zero information this laptop does everything i was hoping to do and it has a 17 3 screen as well best of all the price was slightly better than any other place around after doing some self educating i decided that a dell laptop was on my shortlist of brands i wanted to look into it all worked out great 3 months later just thought i would give an update laptop still performing excellent boots up in about 20 seconds shuts down very quick as well still using this mainly a a streaming laptop and its done a fantastic job windows 8 takes getting used to people make such a fuss about having the latest os on there computers to me its just an os and its the other softwares that i am concerned about a shame so many people gave this a 1 star simply because they didn t care for windows 8 also i am using a tp link router and haven t had any issues with wireless connections wireless can be finicky in homes due to range and walls and your wifi one final mention about price i did a lot of researching at all other laptops before finally settling on this one i shopped for about a month before buying this one based on screensize processor speed ram hdmi output hd size and wifi granted this was 3 months ago now and i did exclude certain brand names known to be problematic this laptop was by far and away the best deal at the time as i saw it still very happy and would recommend this one
