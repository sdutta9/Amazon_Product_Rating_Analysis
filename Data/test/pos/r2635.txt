i was very excited about this tablet because i d be using it for school and all but i was extremely disappointed as soon as i opened the box inside the box was nothing but the charger and tablet itself no manual nothing else just that the packaging was ok just some bubble wrap the tablet itself was some what dirty the worst part is that as soon as i took the charger out of the box i noticed it was broken at first i thought maybe it broke on the way here but it has crazy glue on it the owner actually crazy glued the broken charger back together which obviously doesn t work i tried to turn on the tablet and it did not not_not turn on i thought maybe the genius who glued the charger did a good job so i plugged the charger and it wasn t surprising that the charger obviously didn t work i page about 200 for this piece of crap that won t even turn on i m obviously returning and will most likely buy a new one
