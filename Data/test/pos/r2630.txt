contrary to the negative reviews my experience thus far has been great i did have to keep the device plugged in due to device not not_not recognizing the battery and had to do what seemed like endless updates however once i was fully updated everything worked as it should battery was recognized and drivers installed properly and is an excellent tablet 4 stars due to light scuffs on the back of the surface not not_not a deal breaker functions flawlessly mini hdmi is an awesome feature too our i pad can t touch this thing there really is no comparison surface is essentially a lap top lite where as the i pad is a glorified i phone that can t make calls i purchased this for my better half and she uses it in her day to day all the time watching netflix listening to music even in the kitchen as her digital recipe book i can t resist hijacking it from time to time to play games on it though overall very happy with my purchase
