great laptop at a great price the only downside is that the memory is so small that i have had to pick and choose what i download and remove some programs before adding others and no there is no way to add more on this unit for example i wanted to add an additional wireless printer yesterday but i had to find a bunch of files that could be deleted just to make room ugh on the plus side the laptop is lightweight versatile and is super fast it is a great home lap top if you are just using it mostly for facebook email and of course shopping on amazon it also works well for printing coupons and since adding the windows products my daughters can easily write papers etc i do recommend it for any one who doesn t need a lot of storage
