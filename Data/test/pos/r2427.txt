this computer sucks the operating system sucks microsoft sucks windows 8 1 is the worst operating system ever invented i ordered a canon brand new all in one wireless printer and it will not not_not work with 8 1 canon support said i had to call microsoft to unlock programs so it would work microsoft wanted 200 in tech support to do that ok the printer went back in the box and back to amazon i bought a 29 printer because 8 1 cannot handle anything smarter than that seriously the first pc i bought in 1996 was way easier to use that this junk trying to make everything way too fancy and it works like crap and on top of all of that the mcafee pop ups forcing you to subscribe to their security service will make you wish you were dead buy an apple it s more money but at least they know how to make operating systems that work oh yea the new word and excel programs bite the big one too free google drive kicks their butt
