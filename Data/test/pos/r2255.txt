i love this laptop i really do there are some things you may want to know about it and how to overcome the bad ones first of all is the weight its almost 5 5 lbs but you cant do anything about it it has an optical drive excellent addition in my opinion it has bluetooth hdmi out and a large hdd they sell you this waves maxxaudio 4 technology but this laptop sound just like most out there i use my bose soundlink mini and the sound is very pleasing the screen is also just like any other laptop in quality terms the plus is the touchscreen very accurate the limit for ram is 8gb so put that extra 4gb in your cart together with this laptop here is the one i bought with the laptop the biggest bottleneck even though its very big is its hdd 750gb is a lot but its slow at 5400 rpm i got an external case usb 3 0 for the included 750gb and grabbed the new 850 evo the 250gb one and it worked wonders for boot up times and the startup of the programs the processor is the same one used in more expensive laptops so nothing to say about it other peripherals are 1 usb 3 0 2 usb 2 0 there is no reason to not not_not get this laptop buy it you wont regret it
