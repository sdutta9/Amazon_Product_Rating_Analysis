this is a pretty fast computer for an a 8 processor love the touch screen and the fact that it converts to a tablet when in tablet mode the computer is a little heavy if holding it for long periods at a time i personally don t like having the key pad exposed but it don t do anything to the screen because in the tablet mode the key pad is turned off
