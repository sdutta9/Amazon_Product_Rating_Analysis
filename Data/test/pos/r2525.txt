i was deciding between a macbook and this as my nine year old macbook couldn t be updated enough for current software otherwise was still perfect i don t use my laptop a lot as i use my ipad so i didn t want to spend a lot of money this computer had what i needed i knew it came with windows 8 1 and i would have to upgrade i guess i didn t expect to have to spend a day and a half upgrading to windows 10 now that it s upgraded all seems to be fine
