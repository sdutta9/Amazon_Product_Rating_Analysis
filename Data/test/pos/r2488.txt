i eventually changed the memory stick from 4gb to 8gb i would not not_not advise anyone to attempt doing it without some experience in opening laptops because it was a real pain i had to open the case remove the battery remove the fan remove the motherboard to be able to access the memory slots a long shot from how easy it used to be ie open a memory trap at the back of the laptop with this laptop nothing is easily accessible the good thing is that i have figured out that instead of buying a 8gb stick i should have ordered a 4gb because they are two slots for memory since the laptop should not not_not support more than 8gb i am now with a 4gb memory card on my hands however the process was so lengthy and prone to issues that i won t attempt changing it again for info the memory is ddr3 1600 pc3 12800 the laptops now boot from scratch to my face login in about 13 seconds and finishes loading in about 25 pretty cool it took about 3 reboots to get this score time for windows to adapt to the new ram the first run took more than one minute to boot i ran the experience index again and it definitely improved it was 5 9 and it went to 7 0 for the memory another update i just finished swapping the hard drive too for a 256gb corsair force lx sata 3 ssd the hd score went from 5 9 to 8 2 i was surprised because i thought that the max score was 7 9 but it appears that the max score has been raised to 9 9 under win8 1 the boot time is still around 20 seconds not not_not a huge improvement but it is normal since most boot up info is located in the ram if i could only upgrade the video card i may end up with a real racing machine
