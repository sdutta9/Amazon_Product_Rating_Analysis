i was actually surprised to see that the back is actual aluminum rather than just plastic full keyboard and a touchpad i can t using a touchpad so i can t comment on that has all of the ports i expect to see in a laptop hdmi 3 5mm audio ethernet 3 usb an sd card reader and a standard power connector also has a disk drive though i wish it was replaced with the option to add a second storage drive the 500gb 5400rpm hard drive that comes with it is slow to be expected in a laptop at this price so i replaced it with an intel 530 ssd a single ram slot means i d have to replace the ram that it comes with rather than add to it if i ever decide that i need more the reason i picked out this laptop is the screen cheap laptops come with 1360x768 resolution screens with very few exceptions frankly i think that is just not not_not an acceptable resolution for any screen bigger than 12 34 fortunately this was an exception to that rule it has a 1600x900 resolution screen which still wasn t the 1080p i really wanted but i was on a budget and decided this is good enough i have to say i was disappointed with the quality of the screen the colors are bad and get much worse very quickly when looking at the screen from any angle when i was reading reviews before purchasing i remember a couple people mentioning having problems with the wifi card at one point mine stopped working but i just opened windows device manager and disabled re enabled it and it immediately fixed the problem when i get a laptop that is inevitably loaded with all kinds of junkware the first thing i do is reinstall the os i had to do this anyway after installing my ssd in the past i don t think i ve ever seen a laptop that didn t come with a windows activation key but once again this one proves to be an exception fortunately i had an extra one so it didn t cause a serious problem all thing considered an intel core i3 and a 1600x900 screen are worth the price i paid
