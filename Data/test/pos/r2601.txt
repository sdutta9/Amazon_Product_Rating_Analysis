received a product that was not not_not in new form after powering on the laptop which was in standby hibernate i believe i was greeted with a 34 chuck 34 logged on windows profile also a notepad was open with some gibberish typed in i immediately restored the laptop to factory settings and all is well now i can t say much about the battery life yet but i m concerned about it since this obviously is an used product the product is a 5 star if it were new in my case i give it a 2 star pending further testing of the battery
