could be better could be worse it s definitely a cheap laptop but i don t use it for much if i needed it for a job school or something important it wouldn t be ideal i wish the battery lasted longer especially now that my ac adapter stopped working properly i was able to get a free upgrade to windows 10 and i like it better with the newer windows my husband purchased this laptop for me december of 2014 as a christmas gift it is now october of 2015 and my ac adapter has suddenly stopped charging the laptop so basically 9 months of usage when plugged in it makes the screen brighter but i get an error message saying the adapter i have is not not_not supported i tried plugging in the adapter that goes with my husband s laptop and it works just fine so i know the issue is with the adapter this is a bit annoying since i haven t even had the thing for a year yet this is my third dell laptop i ve had 2 others that lasted a good 5 years and this never happened i looked for a new adapter on amazon and don t feel like i can trust any of the seller the thing costs at least 60 if you want it directly from dell
