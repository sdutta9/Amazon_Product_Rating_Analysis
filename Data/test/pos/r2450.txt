so far i have been delighted with this laptop it s lightweight for it s size the screen is gorgeous the design is sexy and the battery lasts a decent time i wasn t thrilled with the windows 8 1 interface however until a techy friend of my told me about classic shell i much prefer loading to the desktop rather than the start menu splashed all over so basically i have the look and feel of windows 7 again the keyboard is okay but the touchpad leaves much to be desired it doesn t respond well to my touch so i have to use the left click button to often my previous laptop was an inspiron 1721 which has a better keyboard touch and a much less clunky touchpad
