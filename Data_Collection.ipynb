       " u\"I'm mainly a Mac person.  But I've dipped into the PC world with Windows 10.  Since using a Mac all the way back to 1986, I must say Windows 10 is the first version of Windows that isn't an embarrassment when compared to OS X.  It's no El Capitan yet, but if you need a simple rock solid web, email, light Office-ish PC,  I'd finally agree that Macs are underspec'd and overpriced.\\nTake this MacBook for example.  There's no retina screen here.  It's fuzzy old school TN screen tech.  Which if the unit were cheaper would be okay.  But this is classic Apple gauging.  This unit, as spec'd, should be $799.  Why do I say this?  Because I can purchase on Amazon right now the Asus UX305 with the same sort of screen but at Full HD, twice the SSD storage, and a fanless experience thanks to the Core M processor.  For $100 less.  Actually $200 less with a current rebate.  And I mean $200 less than my make pretend price of $799 -- NOT THE ACTUAL PRICE OF $999.\\nNow I know us Mac types start talking about virus and malware.  I get it, I do.  But Win10 comes with it's own anti-viral software that appears to be working fine.  And virus and malware issues are typically user stupidity mixed with OS issues.  So if you school yourself on how to avoid bad things it seems you likely will.\\nAs a Mac fan I wouldn't even be looking at PCs if Macs were more reasonably priced and spec'd.  Heck -- I'd settle for this price if the SSD doubled and the screen was HD.  But Apple expects you to take their gauging TWICE these days.  I say give it to Apple ONCE by skipping this laptop altogether -- until their greedy little paws at least give you better spec.  OS X simply isn't worth $400 more with half the spec anymore.\",\n",
       " u\"I read all the reviews. I compared other manufacturers specs. I finally decided on this Mac. Got it yesterday and love it. I'm a graphic designer and wasn't sure about the screen resolution. I wish it was more, but it's still pretty good. Actually because of this computers size images appear much sharper then I thought. Its lightning fast and it is an exceptional all around computer. The build is top notch as all Apple products seem to be. I'm satisfied.\",\n",
       " u'I had a pc and switched to this, but now kind of disappointed.',\n",
       " u'On time and as promised',\n",
       " u'Thanks for the Apple MacBook Pro',\n",
       " u'I LOVE it',\n",
       " u\"It's just as advertised. Don't know how we got along without it. Video playback and images extremely high quality. Only needs to be charged every 12 hours, so no need to look for outlets in public places.\",\n",
       " u\"I've owned three MacBook Air's in my life, and I've always loved them.  I've even owned another unit of this model, which was amazing, so this review is solely for the units being sold by Amazon.  The following are a list of my complaints, and why I rated this laptop 3 stars.\\n1) Packaging/Handling:  I'm starting to think that the reason these MacBook Airs are cheaper than others is because the seller knows they're damaged/faulty.\\n2) Quality:  I've ordered one before that arrived in a damaged box and it wouldn't even complete set-up.  I returned it and eventually decided to try again.  This time, the box was once again damaged, and the MacBook has a bit of flex which isn't supposed to happen.  When I hold it one-handed, you can hear creaking occurring.\\n3) Damaged Items:  When I opened this MacBook, I found that on the top and bottom there were several minor, but noticeable, burrs, as if it had been scraped.\\nIf these are the reasons that these laptops are discounted, then the seller/Amazon should notify the customer so that they are aware that they're purchasing a new, but faulty bit of equipment.\",\n",
       " u\"I couldn't be happier. Fast, safe, packaged excellent.\",\n",
       " u'My grandson spent the day with me and the Mac Air  I had bought for my 86th birthday.  This extraordinary machine has already given me access to many new areas of interest, educational and recreational.  Thank you.',\n",
       " u'Amazing!',\n",
       " u'was just what she wanted',\n",
       " u'great',\n",
       " u\"I first had a defective one that wouldn't close properly to seal. I switched it with another one which would electric shock you when plugged in. Then had to switch it again, and now it hangs all the time and gets very hot. Also, when I scroll down, sometimes a paragraph of my text disappears, also often the mouse cursor disappears and you have to click around for it to become visible again. All and all I am super disappointed with this product.\",\n",

       " u\"So far so good. Daughter loves it. She's freshmen in college. Good purchase:)\",\n",
       " u'Laptop is great. However it appears the touchpad was not assembled correctly... There is a slight &#34;tapping&#34; sound on the touchpad (no, not the actual left/right click options). You can even see the touchpad moving up and down; that is not suppose to happen.\\nTook to Apple store and they wanted to ship it off to get fixed.',\n",
       " u'Hey. Some keys in the keyboard are not working. How can we solve this issue.?  LETTER S X por example.',\n",
       " u'Posting this review from this computer, works great and with original manufacturer warranty. I also have a macbook pro and this one is still pretty fast, although slower than the pro.

       " u'The newest version is a nice machine, but beware! It only runs OS 10.10.3 and later, no earlier versions.  This means that you cannot keep iPhoto, you have to move to Photos, a new Apple thing.  All your pics can &#34;be migrated&#34;, of course. You will also be urged to get into iCloud, often.  If you want to do all this at your own speed, and want to stay with an earlier OS for a while, then  stay with an older version of Air.  This is not stated in the specs.',\n",

       " u'Wow!',\n",
       " u\"It took me a long time to join the Mac crowd, but I'm all in now.  I love this MacBook Air.  The battery lasts way longer than any windows notebook I've ever had and the mouse pad - once you get used to it - is light years ahead of any windows mouse pad.\",\n",
       " u\"Writing this on the Macbook Air:\\nWhen I first purchased this, I was skeptical of how fast it ran, how well it handled programs, and how long the battery lasted, as well as storage with the 128 gigs.\\nSo far, I have Microsoft Office 2016, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, Final Cut Pro X, and roughly 10 gigs of songs on the computer. I still have about 78 gigs remaining. So storage likely won't be a problem. If it is, I can easily buy an external HDD that connects via USB.\\nFor the battery, I charged it properly. The day I received it, I plugged it in overnight before ever using it and allowed it to charge fully. Today was the first day I used it. It is currently on hour 14 and is at 9%. My usage includes: VLC Media Player watching movies, iTunes listening to music, pretty much always on Firefox browsing the web, watching YouTube videos, multiple uses of Photoshop and Illustrator, and a single video rendered by Final Cut Pro X. After all that, it is at 9%. Battery life is amazing, as it has been said multiple times. The only changes I've made are to the keyboard backlight, which is set at 1, so the backlight is on but at it's lowest setting. The screen is at the default half setting.\\nAs far as the 4 gigs of RAM. I'm used to working with Windows, which needs about 8 gigs to function decently. Mac OS X, however, manages memory much more efficiently. 4 gigs of RAM allows me to have multiple heavy programs open at once. At the moment, I have Firefox, Photoshop, Mail, iTunes, Photos, Messages, and uTorrent (which is downloading a file), and the computer still doesn't show the slightest sign of struggling. No lag loading webpages, or opening new programs. Opening Activity Monitor shows I'm only using 2.35 gigs of RAM.\\nFor others wondering about the processor, it more than out performs. The Intel i5 combined with the SSD results in Firefox opening instantly, Photoshop and Illustrator take 4-5 seconds to fully load, and other programs (iTunes, Messages, etc) also open instantly.\\nSince the Macbook Air is known for it's weight and how thin it is, I'll comment on that also. As for weight, it's definitely the lightest laptop I've ever owned. Picking it up feels like I'm holding a couple sheets of paper, or perhaps a smartphone with a case on it (in terms of weight of course). When I first started using it, I actually thought it didn't have speakers built in, seeing as how thin it is. After playing one song, I was proven wrong. The speakers are hidden away, but are still great for regular audio listening.\\nThe saying &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; really proves itself here. You pay ~$900 and receive an outstanding computer. Also, as a last note, this was written by a &#34;PC fanboy&#34;, aka somebody who thought they were wasting money buying this.\\nAs a second footnote, this review took me approximately 10 minutes to type, and the battery remains at 9%.\",\n",

I am not a youngin so I like the simplicity this laptop and all Apple products offer~ KEEP YOUR WINDOWS~ that constantly disappear you spend more time trying to figure out how to get back to the page you were just on than being productive with what you are working on.  This MAC lets you do everything and even has demonstrations for first time Mac owners like me!  ~I haven't been off of it since I got it~  it's so lightweight I can take it to bed~the keyboard is comfortable you don't have to press down  so hard and break a fingernail~it's not clunky or chunky or loud (keypad) my arms don't go numb and it has a backlight which is just another added plus~ I also love the magnetic charger and both cables apple includes with this laptop~ it's so convenient  you don't have a hot brick attached to you like other laptops~the battery lasts all day long~ it came a day early (Fulfilled by Amazon) packaged straight from the factory charged and ready to go and unlike the junk i DID NOT have to wait all day to sign for it~ it was left by my front door.  APPLE APPLE APPLE APPLE APPLE  ABSOLUTELY APPLE!\",\n",
       " u'Good',\n",
       " u\"Great computer. I bought it to replace my 2013 MacBook Pro. I just wanted something lighter and more commuter friendly as I walk around a college campus all day. Quick, two day shipping. So far so good. Easy to set up as expected. Can't go wrong with a MacBook. Highly recommended.\",\n",
       " u'Love it SO much!',\n",
       " u\"Very good performance and weight. I've migrate from a macbook pro ,buying an Air in April 2014 (paying around $1,200 bucks - basc version w/ additional 500GB) . It has been working very well until last week. My mac just stopped to work; whenever i plug the power cord to charge it; nothing, no answer, just failed.\\nI've took to a Apple service provider who quote its repair in $500, the problem is in the logic board. I'm so frustrated that after less than 1.5 year of usage, a product which is synonymous of quality and from a brand that I've always trust, fail this big. I'm feeling like abandoned by a brand I'm loyal\\nMy recommendation if you're a mac fan, don't buy it, go for a macbook pro, unless you want to take the risk of your mac suddenly fail\",\n",
       " u'Best investment I ever made',\n",
       " u\"Just requested a replacement since the one I received yesterday is not charging. The battery condition is &#34;replace now&#34; on a brand new Macbook Air (MJVE2LL/A). I'm willing to give a second chance, but it's really disappointing. I do own many other Apple products and none of them are like this right out of the box.\\nUPDATE:\\nThe replacement was delivered today and no issues. Everything seems to be functioning properly as it should be. An excellent customer service from Amazon Prime (5 stars), but only 4 stars for MBA for the issues with defective battery right out of the box.\",\n",
       " u'Very nice, brand new, same date warranty',\n",
       " u'awesome machine',\n",
       " u'Best computer I have ever used...period. Very robust build, and very user friendly. I believe that people are afraid of Macs because they used to be so very different from a Windows/PC machine. However, they have integrated a Windows feel to them, and any PC user can seamlessly move to Mac, and not be susceptible to viruses and constant Windows crashes.',\n",
       " u'It was a gift for my granddaughter. In college she loves the Macbook.',\n",
       " u'Good',\n",
       " u\"I bought one of these to try some Mac exclusive software for my business. I'm primarily a PC user and this was the first Mac I ever purchased and I was impressed with the laptop even if I ultimately decided to return it.\\nThe Good:\\n-The size and the weight is right. I was looking for something that I could carry around easily (my other laptop is a 10lb gaming behemoth and portable it ain't) and this fit the bill.\\n-It worked quite nicely right out of the gate. There was a bit of a learning curve because I'd only used MacOS in passing on friends' computers over the years, but everything was intuitive enough once I figured it out.\\n-The screen is absolutely beautiful even if it is lower resolution than other laptops in this class.\\n-The battery life. Dear gods above the battery life. I had this thing for a week testing it out and I think I only had to charge it once. Obviously your mileage may vary depending on how much you use the thing, but it certainly holds a charge.\\nThe Bad:\\n-The screen looks nice, but as I mentioned above it's also a smaller resolution and so things can seem a bit cramped at times.\\n-Lack of ports. There just weren't as many USB options, etc., compared to similar non-Apple devices on the market.\\n-The price is also something to consider. The MacBook Air is still a good $150-$200 more expensive than comparable PC devices on the market. You're paying the &#34;Apple Tax&#34; that comes with all of their devices which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you like their stuff and have the money, but be aware that you're paying more for the Apple logo and design.\\nUltimately I decided to return this and go with a comparable and cheaper PC alternative. The Mac exclusive software I was testing ultimately didn't perform any better than the PC version so there was no reason for me to switch from PC. I returned it and purchased a comparable PC alternative from Dell.\\nIf you're an Apple user and you're looking for something that's portable with the usual stellar computing experience you get on an Apple machine then this is definitely worth the money. As long as you don't mind paying a little more for that Apple experience. If you're thinking about migrating from PC then there are cheaper alternatives out there that deliver the same form factor on a Windows machine.\",\n",
       " u'Great communication! Deffinetly recommend :)',\n",
