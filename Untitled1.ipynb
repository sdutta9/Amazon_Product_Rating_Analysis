       "[u\"I'm giving this a 2 stars due to the 1 year manufacturer warranty.My screen got shattered,something heavy was on top of it and I over looked it.Barely had it before the year was up because I got it as a Christmas gift from my mom and stepdad last Christmas.I took it to a Microsoft store and asked about if shattered screens are covered ny the warranty and they said no.It's about a $320 service order because they wipe out your memory and give you a new one.If I had an IPad and shattered my screen,Apple would give me a whole new one as long as the one year manufacturer warranty wasn't up.I've used that with my Iphone and they were super helpful.My stepdad talked me into getting the surface pro 2 and pumped me up saying he wish he had one(yet he has an IPad).This product doesn't have the same apps as Apple so it was a lil more time consuming to figure out.Good picture,good size and it's convenient for word,excel,and other Microsoft office documents.But the touch screen is super sensitive.It doesn't select words the same as Apple.Overall,I'm now going to send it as a service order and then possibly sell it if I can to get an IPad.I'm sorry but I will always be an apple snob.I like PCs though but I'd rather have a laptop than this type of tablet.A laptop is way easier for me to navigate than this invention Microsoft made.Apple-1 Microsoft-0\",\n",
       " u'The Surface works but does not recognize the Surface 2 Keyboard. After resetting the Surface and updating the UEFI driver it still does not work.',\n",
       " u\"Very disappointed. Its my own fault I didn't research it well before buying it. I was looking for something light weight and like a laptop so I could work anywhere I could get internet. I didn't know how EXTREMELY limiting Windows RT was!!!! You can only use the apps they provide which so many of the popular ones used aren't available. I can't use it for work bc I need CITRIX and the app doesn't work. When I looked it up, everyone complains about the same thing! So honestly it was a huge waste of money for what I would use it for. I can't even just give it to my son bc the games that he plays aren't available! I'm hoping I can look into trading it in and going for a newer version that allows full function of windows and you can get the programs and apps that so many people use! And be able to work.....\\nI left it sitting there unused for so long I didn't realize my return time had passed so I'm stuck with it and will take a loss in money. \\x1a\",\n",
       " u\"I discovered that Windows RT is very limited and I doesn't suggest to buy RT version\",\n",
       " u\"I have been using my Surface 2 for 8 to 10 hours per day for about five weeks straight now. I like it very much.\\nThe keyboard/cover is important for usability. It's an extra purchase, but it really enables good content creation. I use all four of the Office products (Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint). I haven't tried anything really fancy like macros, but for basic tasks the Office suite is very usable.\\nThe USB drive is actually the reason I got the Surface instead of an iPad. The USB drive is really useful for convenient file sharing.\\nI also use OneNote to sync automatically with other devices. OneNote is pre-installed.\\nSince the Surface 2 runs RT, I can't download many regular Windows applications. For screenshots, I use the charm Send To function (I send to OneNote, then copy from OneNote and paste into Windows) or the charm Email facility (I email myself screenshots). Both techniques are functional but seem a little clumsy compared to a true Windows application such as Godwin.\\nI can't run a full fledged computer programming interactive development environment (that is too advanced for RT), but I can use Remote Desktop Connection to connect to a Windows server on a cloud provider like Amazon Web Service. I installed Metro PuTTY from the Store and that allows me to connect to a hosted Linux server in the cloud.\\nBy the way, the Surface 2 only runs its own Internet Explorer browser - no Chrome or Firefox allowed. This restriction does cause an issue occasionally because some sites don't run correctly on the IE browser. As an easy workaround, I sign into my above mentioned Windows server and use Chrome there.\\nMy favorite features are its weight and its coolness. I have read it weighs in at two pounds. I guess that's right - I can't tell exactly. But it feels light. I can keep it on my lap for hours and not feel weighed down. It feels light in my briefcase.  As far as temperature, it never heats up, or if it does I've never noticed it.\\nI've experienced two glitches. First, it is possible to think that your keyboard is attached, when in fact it is magnetized but not actually attached. I spent a while trying to discern the pattern of why sometime the keyboard worked and sometime the keyboard failed. It was completely a matter of making sure the contacts are actually connected between the keyboard and the Surface.\\nThe other glitch is related to the Sleep function. When I actively sleep the machine and then wake it later, it is sometimes mostly unresponsive. I have learned to keep it on all day and then actively do a Shut Down. Sometimes if I walk away from the machine and then it times out and sleeps, when I return I have to power it off and then power it back on to ensure it's fully responsive. This is annoying, but all the conveniences of the device far outweigh this issue.\\nAs this review indicates, I literally tell my family occasionally, &#34;I love my Surface.&#34; Everybody loves hearing about an unexpected, good surprise. My family members just smile, and they say they don't get tired of hearing me say it.\",\n",
       " u\"The product arrived and the battery doesn't work. What the hell, brand new and it refuses to charge. Turns out its a common problem. Trying to fix it or I'll return it\",\n",
       " u'Love it',\n",
       " u\"Purchased this machine trying to save a bit of money thinking...it should be just as good as the surface 3----WRONG!!!  My husband has the 3.  This one arrived (literally 3 hours ago).  The first problem I experienced was that after selecting &#34;make this a new PC&#34; it automatically linked with my desk top and configured it as such.***Note***I did not want it configured to my desktop!!!! It also gave an option to configure to the desktop which I did NOT select.  The second thing I noticed was that after about 20 minutes the battery wouldn't charge.  At first, I thought maybe it was dead and needed some time but it never charged.  I tried looking through the settings thinking maybe I needed to turn it on or something....WRONG AGAIN!!!!  It turns out that many of the Surface 2's have an issue with the drivers that operate the battery....I was not about to go through an hour of BS to try and get this thing to function the way should after freshly opening this new device.  Needless to say, I was pissed.  I don't understand why Microsoft continues to sell these (surface 2) if they are experiencing these types of problems----fresh out the box!!!!!!!  I'm thinking of ordering the surface 3....but I think I'll wait to make sure my husband doesn't experience any glitches with it first.....BEWARE OF THE SURFACE 2\",\n",
       " u'I am horribly disappointed by this product. The screen has a major defect.',\n",
       " u\"SCAM!! People are selling used Surface 2's as &#34;NEW&#34;. After some internet research, seems to be a trend. This tablet is worn worse than the last one I ordered a month prior. Very disappointing!! All corners and edges show heavy use. Keyboard and charger connection points worn and marked up, small scratches on screen and no documentation just to list a few things. Terrible product.\"]"
