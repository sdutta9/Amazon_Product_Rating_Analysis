R2P1ULL469X19H->Very disappointed - whether it is the fault of Dell, Windows 10, or Dell's adaptation to Windows is beyond me. In one (of two) regular locations, the computer could not connect to the wireless router until I rebooted the router - no other devises in the home had this problem. It has rebooted spontaneously, shut done incorrectly, and frozen up, requiring popping the battery in order to unfreeze it. It has trouble recognizing the external monitor which I rely on for color consistency when editing photos. It does not recognize external hard drives plugged into a USB3 7-port, but recognizes them immediately when they are plugged into a USB2 - which is plugged into the USB3. In my other location, it recognizes the external hard drives plugged intoUSB3. What strange thing is it going to do next. I have had it for about a month and have come to distrust it. I expected much better, and got something much worse.

R31T8GWXHLBSTM->This computer is awesome. It does everything that you or I can do. Windows 10 takes some time getting use-to, but once you catch on, WOW, I really like this computer, it is very fast.

R3589UVUXCWR83->I am thrilled with this laptop.  The casing is plastic, but still solid. Applications load quickly. No delay on downloads. WiFi connection is strong. The mouse track and keyboard are responsive. The sound is crisp. It runs quietly and stays relatively cool. What I didn't expect is the display is touch screen. I love that.
With an i3 core processor, 8 GB of RAM, TB of Hard-drive space, an Intel Graphics HD card, DVD burner, HDMI, Ethernet and 3 USB ports, I definitely received my money's worth.
I would recommend this laptop to both my family and friends
RI6R2YDW3TGQN->I like it.
R2D3OCVO8NMDHF->Received a product that was NOT in new form. After powering on the laptop (which was in standby/hibernate I believe), I was greeted with a &#34;Chuck&#34; logged-on Windows profile. Also a notepad was open with some gibberish typed in. I immediately restored the laptop to factory settings and all is well now. I can't say much about the battery life yet, but i'm concerned about it, since this obviously is an used product. The product is a 5 star if it were new. In my case, I give it a 2-star, pending further testing of the battery.
R3PMSNYP8O8852->None

RXLLP1MMUJ629->None
R13N01KB3GO33Z->I am satisfied with my purchase , I have almost a month to have it and so far so good . You have what they offer. At first I had problems with wifi but I knew investigating Windows 10 loses connectivity , but it was only the beginning .
R2RHLMK4W711CG->None
R3G8YRZLMW23QI->None
R20YLNB62F3J6K->Would give it less than 1 star if I could. Just got it today and keeps getting stuck in automatic repair loop. Already did clean install of windows and same issue. I do not have time for this garbage, about to send it back. Recently purchased a Dell all in one and it has performed flawlessly. 5000 series laptop appears to be a lemon product.
-working fine after second reinstall of windows with HD format and delete some dell software. Appears to be an issue with Dell software, which I did not want on there anyway.
R1B007LOAND1UH->This is an awesome computer. I have had a desk top for 15 years and really like the convenience and portability.
R1QKUG6JWEQIB8->The touch pad did not work after spending 3 hours with Dell support, I returned the laptop and have not ordered another one yet!  A lot of the non favorable reviews have had problems with the touchpad!
