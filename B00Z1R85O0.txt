R16Y06VDDPNXKV->This was my first refurbished laptop purchase. ItÂ’s very good. Hard to notice any difference between this refurbished one and the new one. Excellent quality refurb.
R3EGKV35UWTFSS->this  is one of the best machines available for the price. Outstanding for general daily use. The touchscreen works very well, and tablet mode provides a welcome benefit while working in cramped spaces, like an airplane or classroom. Overall an excellent machine.
R3BMJB5DTQ4XCN->I use this for everyday browsing and also for work related tasks. I love the versatility of the product as far as switching between tablet and laptop it is exactly what I have been needing. I would recommend this product for anyone that needs the power of a laptop but also the convenience of a tablet. Great product!
R13OA843GNBIE9->Does not charge. &#34;Plugged in, not charging&#34;
RBU2Y1T01DKVP->Good
R13ZY5XMUQLQS1->I have been without a computer for 2 years. My excitement turned to despair when it would not charge.
RG9FP3ZU8AB2O->Am back home now with my awesome 2 in 1. Only to realize that it's not keeping charge until it's not charging any at all now. Really don't know what's going on.
R1BBTAK5U9GUKP->Just as described. Fast shipping. Would recommend to anyone.
R3J6ZBSU0TV7YO->I'm not even going to give this review a star because I'm so upset at the fact that this computer doesn't work when it was shipped to me I'm highly upset with this product is not working and I have to send it back and wait for another computer that hopefully will work !!!!
R84JTOJIG98AA->Great computer. Perfect for home, school, and work use. Small size makes it easy to take anywhere.
RMC4SH5DMZI7R->Well the item works, it has a flaw which makes the mouse stay stuck if you dont move it for like 5 min. Then you have to close the Pc and reopen it for it to work again.
R1Z7P1ZA8PGHX6->very good, I love using it
R26GHRP8T0W19L->I am a Professor and Developer ... my husband is very complicated and I am traveling from one place to another continuously ... this is my perfect tool !!!
RMEP4RZWATZBE->I just got my new dell inspiron 11 2 in 1 and it great its faster then my dell 9300 laptop.I been a long time dell customer and I can t wait to get my next dell product im very happy.
R3MRI8H154S0DB->Small, light, yet useful and sufficiently fast computer that helps with everyday work. It's a great choice for those who want to do regular work on their computer and not to spend a lot of money. Of course, this laptop can't be expected to run games smoothly but I guess everyone who buys a laptop in this price range must know that playing latest games is not realistic. The only con I see is the slower hard drive. The HDD slows down the real potencial of this computer, but then again, it's just alright for this price.
