R136GNUOSQN83A->Did not work!
R2190R3IEU9TN6->I like the computer.  The keys have stuck one time so far, if it becomes a problem, I will return it.
RSEIJPRNX0Q9X->SSD was of poor quality and died in 3 months.  Wife is a teacher, and lost all of her work....do not buy....ever
R3EBQDBWD44V0E->None
R2NOJ2WZ8LQANZ->I was a little leery about buying a refurbished computer.  I would say not to have any qualms about buying from this seller.  Unit arrived super clean and is extremely fast.  I am very pleased with my purchase.  Going to buy another one for my wife.

R3PGW6NHDERA2H->For the price, this is an awesome deal. My refurbished laptop arrived looking and running like brand new. In fact, It's considerably faster than the $800 laptop it replaced. It's missing a couple of features than would have been nice (side numbers and a webcam) but the webcam is pretty much a luxury anyway, and I have one on another laptop. The reason I bought this was that I had previously bought one for my daughter to start college with, and I was so impressed with that one that I purchased a second one. It's a workhorse of a computer and takes all that I can throw at is as a web developer and graphic designer. In fact, I'm sick that I spent $1250 on a new Toshiba back in January when this one performs just as well. I noticed that some other reviews stated problems with some sellers and units that came in with different specs than advertised. I was lucky in that mine's exactly as advertised. Providing you don't have those problems, I can't recommend this laptop highly enough. Dell Latitude E6420 Premium-Built 14.1-Inch Business Laptop (Intel Core i5 2.5GHz with 3.2G Turbo Frequency, 4G RAM, 128G SSD, Windows 7 Professional 64-bit, Certified Refurbished)

REXRN4KO84D5A->No problems with using this laptop. It is fast but you need to become comfortable with typing the numbers from the top rather than the side.
RWPM0L37Z74UY->I am giving this laptop 5 stars, as this really is a great value overall. On the positive side, my &#34;refurbished&#34; laptop arrived in extremely great shape, with no discernible scratches and fully functional. I went ahead and checked the internals as well, (not for your average home user), and it was very clean. My particular unit was manufactured in May of 2012, and I am thinking it did not have a lot of mileage to it. It does come with a new clean installation of Windows 7 64 bit Professional, ready to boot up and install. The battery seemed in good shape, and passed the Dell website battery diagnostic test. In addition, while these machines are out of original warranty, (3 years), the Dell website is full of easy to use support options, even offering an extended warranty if you wish to pay for it. A machine like this, refurbished from Dell proper, will run $700 to $800. You might want to read the reviews on the Dell E6420 on the Web, as it is a robust laptop, made for travel and not made of egg shells. Fantastic machine. On the critical side, my unit came with the i5-2410M Intel Sandy Bridge processor, and not the i5-2520, (as advertised), and the i5-2410M is slightly slower, with a base of 2.3 Ghz., and turbo boost (sustained) of 2.8 Ghz. In addition, the 4 GB of RAM, (2 x 2 GB modules), were miss matched in speed, so they were only running at 533 Mhz, and not 667 Mhz. I went ahead and changed them out to new 2 new Corsair RAM modules at 4 GB, for a total of 8 GB dual channel memory, now running at 800 Mhz. I was not crazy about the old Samsung 128 GB SSD that came with the Laptop, so I changed it out to a new Toshiba 256 GB Q Series Pro SSD, and I ran an additional clean install of Windows 7 64 bit Professional. The new RAM and new SSD made a reasonably fast laptop even faster. You can use this laptop for very demanding applications without the computer lagging or slowing down. The only area this laptop might fall short on would be for intensive graphics associated with complex PC games, 3D rendering, or intense video editing. For most business and home applications, this laptop will more then keep up. Keep in mind, that if you need any additional drivers or support, you can get it all at the Dell website. I went ahead and updated the BIOS and  checked for the most up to date drivers off of the Dell website. Also, be prepared to take some time on the first install of Windows 7, that there will be about 200 to 220 updates needed almost immediately once you get the machine up and running and hooked up to the Internet. On the bright side, you did not get a new laptop with a &#34;ton&#34; of stupid bloatware and junk you did not want or need. These Dell Machines do come in slightly different configurations, and are being sold by different secondary vendors. Mine came from TechHarvard, but there are 2 or 3 other vendors selling these as well under this same heading. While I feel very positive about buying this refurbished laptop, and I know I got an excellent value, individual results may vary. Quite frankly, I would buy this machine again, and I would buy this refurbished Dell laptop ahead of most of the new junk that you can find in the Retail stores. If you are on a budget, and you need a great laptop, you could not go wrong buying this unit. If you are not on a budget, go ahead and get the new Dell E6440 laptop, but be prepared to fork over $1,200 or so for the privilege. Trust me, the Dell E6440 is not going to perform much better then this refurbished E6420, and if the new E6440 comes with a standard hard drive instead of an SSD, it will be a slower machine. If in doubt, just buy it.
RFY24TF12DGM8->None
R1LI26YXLC34S0->I rated this product 4 stars due to it missing a screw on the bottom of the case. It also came with a cheap charger which requires a little longer to charge the battery. Overall, I like the product. It's a tad bit on the slow side, however, gets the job done.
R2X4KYTKBDZ80K->None
R35JSKQCMOD9B5->None
R9QCR8081JYWR->Allow time for a re-install of the Operating System!  The product code provided for this refurbished machine required a complete re-install which took about 90 minutes. Once that was done, all has been good. I found the docking station that works with this on Amazon, too.
R87C9SJD4HC2S->I have been using it for three weeks. But it has developed a problem it shutts off (goes dead) on its own while using it.  You can boot it back up. But during the day this can happen multiple times.  I am looking to exchange it.
R2VRBW9LYXO3LG->Works as expected.  Like new

R6A5ZC7BS8CA9->As advertised.
R3KHHS6SGYXY0D->Had to send back. Did not operate correctly
R1BU9APBBQUOEJ->My purchase arrived on time and package really good. The computer preforms wickedly fast. Happy about that. But, I ordered this particular model for it's factory features, Bluetooth, on board camera and a telephone modem which I still use for faxing. None of those three items are functional. The camera and phone don't have drivers and the Bluetooth module is missing from the computer. Contacted the manufacturer's service (Joyssystems, one of Microsoft's top refurbers)  department 2 days ago and no response from them. I have always had good luck with refurbs until this purchase. Might have to rethink my cheapness. Going to keep the unit is runs great and have the tools for working around those three issues.H.L.
